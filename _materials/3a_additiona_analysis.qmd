We have access to 5min resting state each condition for each subject. <!-- //to verify --> We computed the values of the exponent and offset for each region and presented them in the @fig-brain-plot-rs.

Mean values of exponent and offset averaged for the trials before tDCS stimulation and before sound stimulation

We wanted to extract the parametrisation in the resting state and then use this to see how this will interact within the spectral stimulation. The spatial aspect of analysis is interesting

In first part of analysis, cortical gamma synchrony was computed in MEG only before tDCS stimulation.


##  RBA and quantyfying the effect of sound stimulation on single variable

In the first part I want to to compare  PRE-REAL and PRE-SHAM if there are any systematic differences between  those conditions that should theoretically be equivalent.

The models checking the differences will have the form
$$
Variable_{ T:real, S:prestim} - Variable_{T:sham, S:prestim} \sim 1 + (1 | roi) + (1 + subject)
$$

and
$$
Variable_{ T:real, S:stim} - Variable_{T:sham, S:stim} \sim 1 + (1 | roi) + (1 + subject)
$$


Also, after combining T:real and T:sham when P:PRE MEG I would like to compute  the basic topographical maps of the variables computing the maps of the specparam variables in the baseline  (or all  4 points together?)

$$
Variable_{\text{S:prestim}} \sim 1 + (1 | roi) + (1 + subject)
$$


After checking if  the is no systematic difference , I  want to quantify impact on sound stimulation on variables using RBA by fitting the model on the differences  between conditions.


$$
Variable_{S:stim} - Variable_{S:prestim} \sim 1 + (1 | roi) + (1 + subject)
$$


for  variable being ITPC, Exponent and Offset.


The alternative to `RBA` would be to  implement the model directly in `brms` with the form 
$$ Variable \sim  1+ S + (1 + S| roi) +   (1 + S| subject) $$, but I we started out initial analysis with RBA  contrast  based approach, as it give more straightworward interpretation and we can easily retrieve P+. 

<!-- 
###  Mixed Effects Model (or bayesian hierarchical multilevel models)

the the difference of the $ITPC_{stim} - ITPC_{nostim}$ (  baseline corrected ITPC) was used in the further analysis, producing an estimate of regional map. Z-scoring  (dividing by the SD of the  pre-stimulation period) were not feasible due to low variability of the  pre-stimulation period.

###  Answering main question 

To answer my main question, wheter the spectral slope (exponent) of  MEG (neural activity) predict inter-trial phase coherence at 40 Hz during auditory steady-state response, and how does this predictive relationship vary across different cortical regions,  I would like to focus on mainly the  S=stimulus condition, to steamline the analysis and enhance interpetability.


The following  set of   models in `brms` would be 


\begin{align}
    ITPC_{s:stim} &\sim 1 + (1|ROI) + (1|Subject) \tag{1} \\
    ITPC_{s:stim} &\sim Exponent_{s:stim} + (1 + Exponent_{s:stim} | ROI) + (1 + Exponent_{s:stim} | Subject) \tag{2} \\
    ITPC_{s:stim} &\sim Offset + (1 + Offset | ROI) + (1 + Offset | Subject) \tag{3}
\end{align}

<!-- $$
ITPC_{S:stim}  \sim  1 + (1 |ROI) + (1 |Subject)
$$

$$
ITPC_{S:stim}  \sim  Exponent_{S:stim}  + (1 + Exponent_{S:stim} | ROI) + (1 + Exponent_{S:stim}  | Subject),
$$


$$
ITPC_{S:stim}  \sim  Offset + (1 + Offset | ROI) + (1 + Offset  | Subject),
$$ -->

And the model with both spectral parameter 

$$
  ITPC_{S:stim}  \sim Offset + Exponent + (1 + Offset + Exponent |ROI) + (1 + Offset + Exponent|Subject),
$$


Potential  addotional model would to use   values of spectral parametrisation  extracted from resting state session recording conducted before the exporiment. 

For the the interpretation 

- I would look  for each cortical region  extracting the region specific coefficient
- Create brain maps showing the spatial distribution of effects
- Highlight regions with P+ > 0.95 or P+ < 0.05 (strong evidence for an effect)

For model comparison I would use LOOIC (Leave-One-Out Information Criterion) or WAIC criterion

###  tDCS Modulation Effects

To  amswer the questiopm wheter bi-hemispheric tDCS modulate neural responses to auditory stimulation, I will try to fit the following model

$$
ITPC_{\text{diff}} \sim 1 + T  + (1|ROI) + (1|Subject)
$$

Where   ITPC_diff  is  POST-PRE difference scores
