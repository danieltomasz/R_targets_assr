  abstract = {Background Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a widely used non-invasive tool to estimate brain activity with high temporal resolution. However, due to the ill-posed nature of the MEG source imaging (MSI) problem, the ability of MSI to identify accurately underlying brain sources along the cortical surface is still uncertain and requires validation. Method We validated the ability of MSI to estimate the background resting state activity of 45 healthy participants by comparing it to the intracranial EEG (iEEG) atlas (https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca/). First, we applied wavelet-based Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM) as an MSI technique. Next, we converted MEG source maps into intracranial space by applying a forward model to the MEG-reconstructed source maps, and estimated virtual iEEG (ViEEG) potentials on each iEEG channel location; we finally quantitatively compared those with actual iEEG signals from the atlas for 38 regions of interest in the canonical frequency bands. Results The MEG spectra were more accurately estimated in the lateral regions compared to the medial regions. The regions with higher amplitude in the ViEEG than in the iEEG were more accurately recovered. In the deep regions, MEG-estimated amplitudes were largely underestimated and the spectra were poorly recovered. Overall, our wMEM results were similar to those obtained with minimum norm or beamformer source localization. Moreover, the MEG largely overestimated oscillatory peaks in the alpha band, especially in the anterior and deep regions. This is possibly due to higher phase synchronization of alpha oscillations over extended regions, exceeding the spatial sensitivity of iEEG but detected by MEG. Importantly, we found that MEG-estimated spectra were more comparable to spectra from the iEEG atlas after the aperiodic components were removed. Conclusion This study identifies brain regions and frequencies for which MEG source analysis is likely to be reliable, a promising step towards resolving the uncertainty in recovering intracerebral activity from non-invasive MEG studies.},

  abstract = {Brain function is a product of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) brain activity. Variation in the regulation of this activity is thought to give rise to normal variation in human traits, and disruptions are thought to potentially underlie a spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions (e.g., Autism, Schizophrenia, Downs' Syndrome, intellectual disability). Hypotheses related to E/I dysfunction have the potential to provide cross-diagnostic explanations and to combine genetic and neurological evidence that exists within and between psychiatric conditions. However, the hypothesis has been difficult to test because: (1) it lacks specificity---an E/I dysfunction could pertain to any level in the neural system- neurotransmitters, single neurons/receptors, local networks of neurons, or global brain balance - most researchers do not define the level at which they are examining E/I function; (2) We lack validated methods for assessing E/I function at any of these neural levels in humans. As a result, it has not been possible to reliably or robustly test the E/I hypothesis of psychiatric disorders in a large cohort or longitudinal patient studies. Currently available, in vivo markers of E/I in humans either carry significant risks (e.g., deep brain electrode recordings or using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with radioactive tracers) and/or are highly restrictive (e.g., limited spatial extent for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS). More recently, a range of novel Electroencephalography (EEG) features has been described, which could serve as proxy markers for E/I at a given level of inference. Thus, in this perspective review, we survey the theories and experimental evidence underlying 6 novel EEG markers and their biological underpinnings at a specific neural level. These cheap-to-record and scalable proxy markers may offer clinical utility for identifying subgroups within and between diagnostic categories, thus directing more tailored sub-grouping and, therefore, treatment strategies. However, we argue that studies in clinical populations are premature. To maximize the potential of prospective EEG markers, we first need to understand the link between underlying E/I mechanisms and measurement techniques.},

Gamma primarily occurs during alert brain states characterized by the so-called ``desynchronized'' EEG. Is this because gamma rhythms are devoid of synchrony? In this review we take a historical approach to answering this question. Richard Caton and Adolf Beck were the first to report the rhythmic voltage fluctuations in the animal brain. They were limited by the poor amplification of their early galvanometers. Thus when they presented light or other stimuli, they observed a disappearance of the large resting oscillations. Several groups have since shown that visual stimuli lead to low amplitude gamma rhythms and that groups of neurons in the visual cortices fire together during individual gamma cycles. This synchronous firing can more strongly drive downstream neurons. We discuss how gamma-band synchrony can support ongoing communication between brain regions, and highlight an important fact: there is at least local neuronal synchrony during gamma rhythms. Thus, it is best to refer to the low amplitude, high frequency EEG as an ``activated'', not ``desynchronized'', EEG.},

However, how measures of neural signal complexity manifest in neural activity following environmental stimulation and, more generally, how the electrophysiological characteristics of auditory responses change in states of reduced consciousness remain under-explored. Here, we tested the hypothesis that measures of neural complexity and the spectral slope would discriminate stages of sleep and wakefulness not only in baseline electroencephalography (EEG) activity but also in EEG signals following auditory stimulation. High-density EEG was recorded in 21 participants to determine the spatial relationship between these measures and between EEG recorded pre- and post-auditory stimulation. Results showed that the complexity and the spectral slope in the 2--20 Hz range discriminated between sleep stages and had a high correlation in sleep. In wakefulness, complexity was strongly correlated to the 20--40 Hz spectral slope. Auditory stimulation resulted in reduced complexity in sleep compared to the pre-stimulation EEG activity and modulated the spectral slope in wakefulness. These findings confirm our hypothesis that electrophysiological markers of arousal are sensitive to sleep/wake states in EEG activity during baseline and following auditory stimulation. Our results have direct applications to studies using auditory stimulation to probe neural functions in states of reduced consciousness.},

  abstract = {Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique that noninvasively detects the brain magnetic field from neuronal activations. Conventional MEG measures brain signals using superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). SQUID-MEG requires a cryogenic environment involving a bulky non-magnetic Dewar flask and the consumption of liquid helium, which restricts the variability of the sensor array and the gap between the cortical sources and sensors. Recently, miniature optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have been developed and commercialized. OPMs do not require cryogenic cooling and can be placed within millimeters from the scalp. In the present study, we arranged six OPM sensors on the temporal area to detect auditory-related brain responses in a two-layer magnetically shielded room. We presented the auditory stimuli of 1~kHz pure-tone bursts with 200~ms duration and obtained the M50 and M100 components of auditory-evoked fields. We delivered the periodic stimuli with a 40~Hz repetition rate and observed the gamma-band power changes and inter-trial phase coherence of auditory steady-state responses at 40~Hz. We found that the OPM sensors have a performance comparable to that of conventional SQUID-MEG sensors, and our results suggest the feasibility of using OPM sensors for functional neuroimaging and brain--computer interface applications.},

It is hypothesized that these changes can be associated with a maturation of GABAergic neurotransmission and, subsequently, the age-related changes of excitation--inhibition balance in the neural circuits. One of the reliable paradigms for investigating these effects in the auditory cortex is 40 Hz Auditory Steady-State Response (ASSR), where participants are presented with the periodic auditory stimuli. It is known that such stimuli evoke two types of responses in magnetoencephalography (MEG)---40 Hz steady-state gamma response (or 40 Hz ASSR) and auditory evoked response called sustained Event-Related Field (ERF). Although several studies have been conducted in children, focusing on the changes of 40 Hz ASSR with age, almost nothing is known about the age-related changes of the sustained ERF to the same periodic stimuli and their relationships with changes in the gamma strength. Using MEG, we investigated the association between 40 Hz steady-state gamma response and sustained ERF response to the same stimuli and also their age-related changes in the group of 30 typically developing 7-to-12-year-old children. The results revealed a tight relationship between 40 Hz ASSR and ERF, indicating that the age-related increase in strength of 40 Hz ASSR was associated with the age-related decrease of the amplitude of ERF. These effects were discussed in the light of the maturation of the GABAergic system and excitation--inhibition balance development, which may contribute to the changes in ASSR and ERF.},

The amplitude and frequency of these oscillations are continuously modulated depending on stimulus and behavioral state. This modulation is believed to crucially control information flow across cortical areas. Here we report that in the rat hippocampus gamma oscillation amplitude and frequency vary rapidly, from one cycle to the next. Strikingly, the amplitude of one oscillation predicts the interval to the next. Using in vivo and in vitro whole-cell recordings, we identify the underlying mechanism. We show that cycle-by-cycle fluctuations in amplitude reflect changes in synaptic excitation spanning over an order of magnitude. Despite these rapid variations, synaptic excitation is immediately and proportionally counterbalanced by inhibition. These rapid adjustments in inhibition instantaneously modulate oscillation frequency. So, by rapidly balancing excitation with inhibition, the hippocampal network is able to swiftly modulate gamma oscillations over a wide band of frequencies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 {\textpm} 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells (``neurons'') and 84.6 {\textpm} 9.8 billion NeuN-negative (``nonneuronal'') cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.

  abstract = {Oscillatory activity in the gamma frequency range (30--90 Hz) is a hallmark of the function of the hippocampal network. These oscillations are thought to be important for information processing.Gamma oscillations can be replicated in in vitro models, in which the underlying mechanisms can be analysed systematically.In all in vitro models, gamma oscillations are dependent on GABAA ({$\gamma$}-aminobutyric acid type A)-receptor-mediated inhibition, suggesting that these oscillations are primarily generated by networks of inhibitory interneurons.Fast-spiking, parvalbumin-expressing basket cells are key components of the hippocampal interneuron network. They are extensively interconnected and fire action potentials that are phase-locked to the oscillations.Interneuron network models that are based on mutual inhibition, assuming slow, weak and hyperpolarizing synapses, generate synchronized gamma activity if exposed to a tonic excitatory drive. However, these models are highly sensitive to heterogeneity in the drive.Experimental analysis has revealed that basket cell--basket cell synapses are functionally specialized. They mediate fast, strong and shunting inhibition.Realistic interneuron network models generate synchronized gamma activity with increased robustness against heterogeneity in the tonic excitatory drive.Experimental analysis further reveals that basket cells are rapidly excited through gap junctions and fast glutamatergic synapses.Both gap junctions and fast glutamatergic synapses stabilize gamma activity in interneuron networks.Specialized synaptic properties turn the interneuron network into a robust gamma frequency oscillator. Therefore, interneuron networks might provide a precise reference signal for temporal encoding of information in principal neurons.},

  abstract = {Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used to investigate human brain function. Simulation studies are essential for assessing the validity of EEG analysis methods and the interpretability of results. New method: Here we present a simulation environment for generating EEG data by embedding biologically plausible signal and noise into MRI-based forward models that incorporate individual-subject variability in structure and function. Results: The package includes pipelines for the evaluation and validation of EEG analysis tools for source estimation, functional connectivity, and spatial filtering. EEG dynamics can be simulated using realistic noise and signal models with user specifiable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We also provide a set of quantitative metrics tailored to source estimation, connectivity and spatial filtering applications. Comparison with existing method(s): We provide a larger set of forward solutions for individual MRI-based head models than has been available previously. These head models are surface-based and include two sets of regionsof-interest (ROIs) that have been brought into registration with the brain of each individual using surface-based alignment -- one from a whole brain and the other from a visual cortex atlas. We derive a realistic model of noise by fitting different model components to measured resting state EEG. We also provide a set of quantitative metrics for evaluating source-localization, functional connectivity and spatial filtering methods. Conclusions: The inclusion of a larger number of individual head-models, combined with surface-atlas based labeling of ROIs and plausible models of signal and noise, allows for simulation of EEG data with greater realism than previous packages.},

  abstract = {Background Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with altered sensory processing and perception. Scalp recordings of electrical brain activity time-locked to sensory events (event-related potentials; ERPs) provide precise information on the time-course of related altered neural activity, and can be used to model the cortical loci of the underlying neural networks. Establishing the test-retest reliability of these sensory brain responses in ASD is critical to their use as biomarkers of neural dysfunction in this population. Methods EEG and behavioral data were acquired from 33 children diagnosed with ASD aged 6--9.4 years old, while they performed a child-friendly task at two different time-points, separated by an average of 5.2 months. In two blocked conditions, participants responded to the occurrence of an auditory target that was either preceded or not by repeating visual stimuli. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to assess test-retest reliability of measures of sensory (auditory and visual) ERPs and performance, for the two experimental conditions. To assess the degree of reliability of the variability of responses within individuals, this analysis was performed on the variance of the measurements, in addition to their means. This yielded a total of 24 measures for which ICCs were calculated. Results The data yielded significant good ICC values for 10 of the 24 measurements. These spanned across behavioral and ERPs data, experimental conditions, and mean as well as variance measures. Measures of the visual evoked responses accounted for a disproportionately large number of the significant ICCs; follow-up analyses suggested that the contribution of a greater number of trials to the visual compared to the auditory ERP partially accounted for this. Conclusions This analysis reveals that sensory ERPs and related behavior can be highly reliable across multiple measurement time-points in ASD. The data further suggest that the inter-trial and inter-participant variability reported in the ASD literature likely represents replicable individual participant neural processing differences. The stability of these neuronal readouts supports their use as biomarkers in clinical and translational studies on ASD. Given the minimum interval between test/retest sessions across our cohort, we also conclude that for the tested age-range of {\textasciitilde} 6 to 9.4 years, these reliability measures are valid for at least a 3-month interval. Limitations related to EEG task demands and study length in the context of a clinical trial are considered.},

Methods: Click sequences at around 40 Hz with high (maximum length sequence), medium and low jitters were presented to normal hearing awake adult subjects monaurally. Overlapping MLR responses were deconvolved using the frequency domain CLAD method. In addition, conventional auditory MLRs at 4.88 Hz and ASSRs at 39.1 Hz were obtained in all subjects. Synthetic ASSRs were constructed using different rate and jitter MLRs as base recordings. Contributions of the primary components were investigated by wave elimination using phasors. Results: Findings indicate that the generation of the 40-Hz ASSRs can be explained successfully by the superposition of the ABR and MLR waves generated at that stimulation rate. Na--Pa and Nb--Pb components of the MLR contribute about equally (45\% each), while the wave V of the ABR contributes a lesser amount (10\%). Conclusions: Forty-Hertz ASSRs are composite responses generated by the superposition of the major waves of the ABR and the MLR. Dramatic amplitude increase of the ASSR at 40 Hz is primarily due to the superposition of the resonating Pb component to the Pa wave.},

  abstract = {Oscillatory EEG signals contain both periodic and aperiodic (1/f components), segregating which is important for gaining insights into the underlying neural computations. Several studies have explored the periodic features underlying neural basis of emotion processing, while 1/f component is less explored. Hence, the present study sought to determine whether seeing emotionally laden music video clips have an impact on aperiodic components along with the periodic components and their underlying basis by conceptualizing a biophysically realistic computational model. Using the publicly available Data for Emotional Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP) dataset we elucidate that there is a significant increase in exponent and offset of aperiodic background during high arousal compared to low arousal trials. In contrast, there were no discernible variations between the aperiodic components during the high and low valence categories. In high arousal, we also discovered reduction in alpha power in line with previous studies. Finally, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we employed a biophysically realistic and previously established thalamo-cortical model of neural field activity, which which allowed us to characterize that heightened emotional arousal appears emerge from an increased cooperation in information communication between neuronal populations in reticular and relay nuclei of thalamus. Significance statement Dissociation of emotion and valence and arousal is an established theory in affective neuroscience. Are these dimensions represented in aperiodic background of macrocscopic electrophysiological scales of EEG? We sought to ask this question in the publicly available DEAP data. Our findings of increased aperiodic components during high arousal in contrast to low arousal suggest heightened neural activity alongside an inhibitory influence. Using a neural field model of thalamo-cortical interactions reveals a mechanistic approach that suggests heightened arousal corresponds to an enhanced inhibitory coupling between thalamic reticular and relay neuronal populations. In essence, this study advances our understanding of the intricate relationship between electrophysiological signals and emotion dimensions, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying arousal-related emotional responses.},

  abstract = {Gamma-band activity (30--90 Hz) and the synchronization of neural activity in the gamma-frequency range have been observed in different cortical and subcortical structures and have been associated with different cognitive functions. However, it is still unknown whether gamma-band synchronization subserves a single universal function or a diversity of functions across the full spectrum of cognitive processes. Here, we address this question reviewing the mechanisms of gamma-band oscillation generation and the functions associated with gamma-band activity across several cortical and subcortical structures. Additionally, we raise a plausible explanation of why gamma rhythms are found so ubiquitously across brain structures. Gamma band activity originates from the interplay between inhibition and excitation. We stress that gamma oscillations, associated with this interplay, originate from basic functional motifs that conferred advantages for low-level system processing and multiple cognitive functions throughout evolution. We illustrate the multifunctionality of gamma-band activity by considering its role in neural systems for perception, selective attention, memory, motivation and behavioral control. We conclude that gamma-band oscillations support multiple cognitive processes, rather than a single one, which, however, can be traced back to a limited set of circuit motifs which are found universally across species and brain structures.},

While network oscillations are known to generate rhythmic EEG, the neural basis of broadband EEG remains unexplained. Here, we use biophysical modelling to show that aperiodic neural activity can generate detectable scalp potentials and shape broadband EEG features, but that these aperiodic signals do not significantly perturb brain rhythm quantification. Further model analysis demonstrated that rhythmic EEG signals are profoundly corrupted by shifts in synapse properties. To examine this scenario, we recorded EEGs of human subjects being administered propofol, a general anesthetic and GABA receptor agonist. Drug administration caused broadband EEG changes that quantitatively matched propofol's known effects on GABA receptors. We used our model to correct for these confounding broadband changes, which revealed that delta power, uniquely, increased within seconds of individuals losing consciousness. Altogether, this work details how EEG signals are shaped by neurophysiological factors other than brain rhythms and elucidates how these signals can undermine traditional EEG interpretation.},

Consistent with this notion, excitation-inhibition imbalances are considered a pathophysiological mechanism in many brain disorders including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, methods to measure E/I ratios in human brain networks are lacking. Here, we present a method to quantify a functional E/I ratio (               fE               /               I               ) from neuronal oscillations, and validate it in healthy subjects and children with ASD. We define structural E/I ratio in an               in silico               neuronal network, investigate how it relates to power and long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) of the network's activity, and use these relationships to design the               fE               /               I               algorithm.

The current sources and sinks form dipoles or higher-order n-poles.Extracellular currents arise from many sources, including synaptic currents, fast action potentials and their afterpotentials, calcium spikes and voltage-dependent intrinsic currents.The magnitude of extracellular currents depends critically on two factors: the cytoarchitectural organization of a network and the temporal synchrony of the various current sinks and sources.Depending on the recording method, neuroscientists distinguish between electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocorticogram (ECoG) and local field potential (LFP; also known as micro-, depth or intracranial EEG), although all of these measures refer to the same biophysical process.The electric field is the force 'felt' by an electric charge, and can be transmitted through brain volume. The extent of volume conduction depends on the relationships between the current dipole and the features of the conductive medium.High-density sampling of the extracellular field with contemporary methods enables the calculation of current source density, and therefore the localization of current sinks and sources.The voltage gradients generated by highly synchronous activity of neuronal groups can affect the transmembrane potential of the member neurons and alter their excitability through ephaptic coupling.Synchronous spiking of nearby neurons is the main source of the high-frequency components of the local field.There is a discernable relationship between the temporal evolution of cell assemblies and the time-dependent changes of the spatially distributed currents. High-density, wide-band recordings of the local field can therefore provide access to both afferent inputs and the spiking output of neurons.},

Intrinsic oscillations also entrain to external rhythms, allowing the brain to optimize the processing of predictable events such as speech. Moreover, selective attention to a particular rhythm in a complex environment entails entrainment of neural oscillations to its temporal structure. Entrainment appears to form one of the core mechanisms of selective attention, which is likely to be relevant to certain psychiatric disorders. Deficient entrainment has been found in schizophrenia and dyslexia and mounting evidence also suggests that it may be abnormal in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Accordingly, we suggest that studying entrainment in selective-attention paradigms is likely to reveal mechanisms underlying deficits across multiple disorders.},

Both were awarded Nobel Prizes; Sherrington in 1932 for ``discoveries regarding the function of neurons,'' and Eccles in 1963 for ``discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in central portions of the nerve cell membrane.'' Both spoke about central inhibition at their Nobel Prize Award Ceremonies. The subsequent publications of their talks were entitled ``Inhibition as a coordinative factor'' and ``The ionic mechanism of postsynaptic inhibition'', respectively. Sherrington's work on central inhibition spanned 41\,years (1893--1934), and for Eccles 49\,years (1928--1977). Sherrington first studied central inhibition by observing hind limb muscle responses to electrical (peripheral nerve) and mechanical (muscle) stimulation. He used muscle length and force measurements until the early 1900s and electromyography in the late 1920s. Eccles used these techniques while working with Sherrington, but later employed extracellular microelectrode recording in the spinal cord followed in 1951 by intracellular recording from spinal motoneurons. This considerably advanced our understanding of central inhibition. Sherrington's health was poor during his retirement years but he nonetheless made a small number of largely humanities contributions up to 1951, one year before his death at the age of 94. In contrast, Eccles retained his health and vigor until 3\,years before his death and published prolifically on many subjects during his 22\,years of official retirement. His last neuroscience article appeared in 1994 when he was 91. Despite poor health he continued thinking about his life-long interest, the mind-brain problem, and was attempting to complete his autobiography in the last years of his life.},

Fast electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillations, which typically originate from frontal regions, have been reported to be markedly reduced in schizophrenia. Methods: Here we employed TMS/EEG to assess the natural frequency of the premotor area in a sample of 48 age-matched participants (12 each in major depression disorder (MDD)), bipolar disorder (BPD), schizophrenia (SCZ) and healthy controls. Event related spectral perturbations (ERSP) were obtained for each study participant using wavelet decomposition. Results: TMS resulted in a significant activation of the beta/gamma band response (21--50 Hz) to frontal cortical perturbation in healthy control subjects. By contrast, the main frequencies of frontal EEG responses to TMS were significantly reduced in patients with BPD, MDD and SCZ (11--27 Hz) relative to healthy subjects. Conclusions: Patients with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia showed a significantly lower natural frequency of frontal cortico-thalamocortical circuits compared to healthy controls. These results suggest a common neurobiological mechanism of corticothalamic impairment. The most likely candidates include dysfunction of GABAergic circuits.},

Recent advances in the brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have presented a potential alternative for these people to communicate by detecting neural activity associated with attempted hand or speech movements and translating the decoded intended movements to a control signal for a computer. A technique that could potentially enrich the communication capacity of BCIs is functional electrical stimulation (FES) of paralyzed limbs and face to restore body and facial movements of paralyzed individuals, allowing to add body language and facial expression to communication BCI utterances. Here, we review the current state of the art of existing BCI and FES work in people with paralysis of body and face and propose that a combined BCI-FES approach, which has already proved successful in several applications in stroke and spinal cord injury, can provide a novel promising mode of communication for locked-in individuals.},

Using Bayesian multilevel (BML) modeling, we control two types of error that are more relevant than the conventional false positive rate (FPR): incorrect sign (type S) and incorrect magnitude (type M). BML also aims to achieve two goals: 1) improving modeling efficiency by having one integrative model and thereby dissolving the multiple testing issue, and 2) turning the focus of conventional null hypothesis significant testing (NHST) on FPR into quality control by calibrating type S errors while maintaining a reasonable level of inference efficiency. The performance and validity of this approach are demonstrated through an application at the region of interest (ROI) level, with all the regions on an equal footing: unlike the current approaches under NHST, small regions are not disadvantaged simply because of their physical size. In addition, compared to the massively univariate approach, BML may simultaneously achieve increased spatial specificity and inference efficiency, and promote results reporting in totality and transparency. The benefits of BML are illustrated in performance and quality checking using an experimental dataset. The methodology also avoids the current practice of sharp and arbitrary thresholding in the p-value funnel to which the multidimensional data are reduced. The BML approach with its auxiliary tools is available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.},

  abstract = {Neuroimaging faces the daunting challenge of multiple testing -- an instance of multiplicity -- that is associated with two other issues to some extent: low inference efficiency and poor reproducibility. Typically, the same statistical model is applied to each spatial unit independently in the approach of massively univariate modeling. In dealing with multiplicity, the general strategy employed in the field is the same regardless of the specifics: trust the local ``unbiased'' effect estimates while adjusting the extent of statistical evidence at the global level. However, in this approach, modeling efficiency is compromised because each spatial unit (e.g., voxel, region, matrix element) is treated as an isolated and independent entity during massively univariate modeling. In addition, the required step of multiple testing ``correction'' by taking into consideration spatial relatedness, or neighborhood leverage, can only partly recoup statistical efficiency, resulting in potentially excessive penalization as well as arbitrariness due to thresholding procedures. Moreover, the assigned statistical evidence at the global level heavily relies on the data space (whole brain or a small volume). The present paper reviews how Stein's paradox (1956) motivates a Bayesian multilevel (BML) approach that, rather than fighting multiplicity, embraces it to our advantage through a global calibration process among spatial units. Global calibration is accomplished via a Gaussian distribution for the cross-region effects whose properties are not a priori specified, but a posteriori determined by the data at hand through the BML model. Our framework therefore incorporates multiplicity as integral to the modeling structure, not a separate correction step. By turning multiplicity into a strength, we aim to achieve five goals: 1) improve the model efficiency with a higher predictive accuracy, 2) control the errors of incorrect magnitude and incorrect sign, 3) validate each model relative to competing candidates, 4) reduce the reliance and sensitivity on the choice of data space, and 5) encourage full results reporting. Our modeling proposal reverberates with recent proposals to eliminate the dichotomization of statistical evidence (``significant'' vs. ``non-significant''), to improve the interpretability of study findings, as well as to promote reporting the full gamut of results (not only ``significant'' ones), thereby enhancing research transparency and reproducibility.},

Next, we emphasize the importance of the E/I balance at the synaptic level (homeostatic control of message reception) as a means to achieve the goal (homeostatic control of information transmission) at the network level~and consider how compromised homeostatic plasticity associated with neurological diseases leads to hyperactivity, network instability, and ultimately improper information processing. Lastly, we highlight several pathological conditions related to sensory deafferentation and describe how, in some cases, homeostatic compensation without appropriate sensory inputs can result in phantom perceptions.},

  abstract = {Neuroimaging relies on separate statistical inferences at tens of thousands of spatial locations. Such massively univariate analysis typically requires an adjustment for multiple testing in an attempt to maintain the family-wise error rate at a nominal level of 5\%. First, we examine three sources of substantial information loss that are associated with the common practice under the massively univariate framework: (a) the hierarchical data structures (spatial units and trials) are not well maintained in the modeling process; (b) the adjustment for multiple testing leads to an artificial step of strict thresholding; (c) information is excessively reduced during both modeling and result reporting. These sources of information loss have far-reaching impacts on result interpretability as well as reproducibility in neuroimaging. Second, to improve inference efficiency, predictive accuracy, and generalizability, we propose a Bayesian multilevel modeling framework that closely characterizes the data hierarchies across spatial units and experimental trials. Rather than analyzing the data in a way that first creates multiplicity and then resorts to a post hoc solution to address them, we suggest directly incorporating the cross-space information into one single model under the Bayesian framework (so there is no multiplicity issue). Third, regardless of the modeling framework one adopts, we make four actionable suggestions to alleviate information waste and to improve reproducibility: (1) model data hierarchies, (2) quantify effects, (3) abandon strict dichotomization, and (4) report full results. We provide examples for all of these points using both demo and real studies, including the recent Neuroimaging Analysis Replication and Prediction Study (NARPS).},

  abstract = {Adolf Beck, born in 1863 in Krak{\'o}w (Poland), joined the Department of Physiology of the Jagiellonian University in 1889, to work directly under the prominent professor in physiology Napoleon Cybulski. Following his suggestion, Beck started studies on the electrical brain activity of animals. He recorded negative electrical potentials in several brain areas evoked by peripheral sensory impulses. Using this technique, Beck localised various centres in the brain of several animal species. In doing this, he discovered continuous electrical oscillations in the electrical brain activity and noted that these oscillations ceased after sensory stimulation. This was the first description of desynchronization in electrical brain potentials. He published these findings in 1890 in the German Centralblatt f{\"u}r Physiologie. Immediately, an intense discussion arose under physiologists on the question who could claim being the founder of electroencephalography. Ultimately, Richard Caton from Liverpool showed that he had performed similar experiments in monkeys years earlier. Nevertheless, Beck added several new elements to the nature of electrical brain activity, such as evoked potentials and desynchronization. In looking back, Adolf Beck can be regarded, next to Richard Caton and together with Hans Berger (who later introduced the electrical brain recording method to humans), as one of the founders of electroencephalography.},

  abstract = {Brain rhythms, or neural oscillations, are one the most prominent features of electrical brain recordings. Over the past century, they have been studied for their relationships to healthy behavior, neurological diseases, and physiological changes. Theories have developed for how these oscillations may play key roles in neural communication and computation. Many discoveries have been made by analyzing these rhythms using tools based on the Fourier transform, which decomposes the neural signal as a sum of rhythmic sine waves. However, the rhythms in these signals often have waveforms that significantly deviate from sine waves. Therefore, the standard Fourier decomposition may not be optimal for studying the potential meanings of these nonsinusoidal features. In this dissertation, I begin by reviewing the literature of the sparse reports of nonsinusoidal waveform shape and its potential physiological meaning. Using a dataset of motor cortical electrocorticography recordings from Parkinson's Disease patients, I show that deep brain stimulation treatment decreased the sharp shape of the patients' beta oscillations. Furthermore, I showed that this waveform shape change underlied past reports of phase-amplitude coupling, and that the coupled high gamma power was predominantly coming from the sharp extrema of the nonsinusoidal beta wave. Next, I propose a cycle-by-cycle analysis framework for analyzing the waveform shapes of oscillations across neural recordings. Finally, I apply this framework to study the sawtooth-shaped rodent hippocampal theta rhythm. I found that the waveform shape of this rhythm contained information about the firing rates, synchrony, and sequences of the local hippocampal CA1 neuron population. Rather than being a nuisance, I conclude that these nonsinusoidal features may provide critical, heretofore overlooked physiological information related to neural communication, computation, and cognition.},

  abstract = {Individual alpha frequency (IAF) is a promising electrophysiological marker of interindividual differences in cognitive function. IAF has been linked with trait-like differences in information processing and general intelligence, and provides an empirical basis for the definition of individualized frequency bands. Despite its widespread application, however, there is little consensus on the optimal method for estimating IAF, and many common approaches are prone to bias and inconsistency. Here, we describe an automated strategy for deriving two of the most prevalent IAF estimators in the literature: peak alpha frequency (PAF) and center of gravity (CoG). These indices are calculated from resting-state power spectra that have been smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter (SGF). We evaluate the performance characteristics of this analysis procedure in both empirical and simulated EEG data sets. Applying the SGF technique to resting-state data from n = 63 healthy adults furnished 61 PAF and 62 CoG estimates. The statistical properties of these estimates were consistent with previous reports. Simulation analyses revealed that the SGF routine was able to reliably extract target alpha components, even under relatively noisy spectral conditions. The routine consistently outperformed a simpler method of automated peak detection that did not involve spectral smoothing. The SGF technique is fast, open source, and available in two popular programming languages (MATLAB, Python), and thus can easily be integrated within the most popular M/EEG toolsets (EEGLAB, FieldTrip, MNE-Python). As such, it affords a convenient tool for improving the reliability and replicability of future IAF-related research.},

  abstract = {During rest, intrinsic neural dynamics manifest at multiple timescales, which progressively increase along visual and somatosensory hierarchies. Theoretically, intrinsic timescales are thought to facilitate processing of external stimuli at multiple stages. However, direct links between timescales at rest and sensory processing, as well as translation to the auditory system are lacking. Here, we measured intracranial electroencephalography in 11 human patients with epilepsy (4 women), while listening to pure tones. We show that in the auditory network, intrinsic neural timescales progressively increase, while the spectral exponent flattens, from temporal to entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Within the neocortex, intrinsic timescales exhibit spatial gradients that follow the temporal lobe anatomy. Crucially, intrinsic timescales at baseline can explain the latency of auditory responses: as intrinsic timescales increase, so do the single-electrode response onset and peak latencies. Our results suggest that the human auditory network exhibits a repertoire of intrinsic neural dynamics, which manifest in cortical gradients with millimeter resolution and may provide a variety of temporal windows to support auditory processing. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Endogenous neural dynamics are often characterized by their intrinsic timescales. These are thought to facilitate processing of external stimuli. However, a direct link between intrinsic timing at rest and sensory processing is missing. Here, with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), we show that intrinsic timescales progressively increase from temporal to entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. Intrinsic timescales at baseline can explain the variability in the timing of iEEG responses to sounds: cortical electrodes with fast timescales also show fast and short-lasting responses to auditory stimuli, which progressively increase in the hippocampus and amygdala. Our results suggest that a hierarchy of neural dynamics in the temporal lobe manifests across cortical and limbic structures and can explain the temporal richness of auditory responses.},

Magneto-/encephalography (M/EEG) studies showed that alpha phase indexes visual excitability and task performance. Studies with transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) aim to modulate oscillations and causally impact task performance. Here, we applied right occipital tACS (O2 location) to assess the functional role of alpha phase in a series of experiments. We presented visual stimuli at different pre-determined, experimentally controlled, phases of the entraining tACS signal, hypothesizing that this should result in an oscillatory pattern of visual performance in specifically left hemifield detection tasks. In experiment 1, we applied 10 Hz tACS and used separate psychophysical staircases for six equidistant tACS-phase conditions, obtaining contrast thresholds for detection of visual gratings in left or right hemifield. In experiments 2 and 3, tACS was at EEG-based individual peak alpha frequency. In experiment 2, we measured detection rates for gratings with (pseudo-)fixed contrast. In experiment 3, participants detected brief luminance changes in a custom-built LED device, at eight equidistant alpha phases. In none of the experiments did the primary outcome measure over phase conditions consistently reflect a one-cycle sinusoid. However, post hoc analyses of reaction times (RT) suggested that tACS alpha phase did modulate RT for specifically left hemifield targets in both experiments 1 and 2 (not measured in experiment 3). This observation requires future confirmation, but is in line with the idea that alpha phase causally gates visual inputs through cortical excitability modulation.},

As transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is likely dependent on NMDAR neurotransmission, this preliminary study, conducted in 30 healthy volunteers, assessed the off-line effects of prefrontal anodal tDCS and sham (placebo) treatment on 40-Hz ASSR and aeGBR. Anodal tDCS failed to alter aeGBR but increased both 40-Hz ASSR power, as measured by event-related spectral perturbations (ERSP), and phase locking, as measured by inter-trial phase consistency (ITPC). Inter-individual differences in tDCS-induced increases in ERSP were negatively related to baseline ERSPs. These findings provide tentative support for further study of tDCS as a potential NMDAR neuromodulatory intervention for synchronized auditory gamma response deficits.},

Specifically, gamma oscillations play a crucial role in governing the connectivity between distinct brain regions, which are essential in perception, motor control, memory, and emotions. In this context, we recapitulate various current stimulation methods to induce gamma entrainment. These methods include sensory stimulation, optogenetic modulation, photobiomodulation, and transcranial electrical or magnetic stimulation. Simultaneously, we explore the association between abnormal gamma oscillations and central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders. Evidence suggests that gamma entrainment-inducing stimulation methods offer notable neuroprotection, although somewhat controversial. This review comprehensively discusses the functional role of gamma oscillations in higher-order brain activities from both physiological and pathological perspectives, emphasizing gamma entrainment as a potential therapeutic approach for neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, we discuss future opportunities and challenges in implementing such strategies.},

To establish a conclusive link between LFP and E:I balance, we recorded single units and LFP from the prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats during decision making. Dynamic measures of synaptic coupling strength facilitated direct quantification of E:I balance and revealed a strong inverse relationship to broadband spectral power of LFP. These results provide a critical link between LFP and underlying network properties, opening the door for non-invasive recordings to measure E:I balance in clinical settings.},

However, these recordings are noisy, both because the neuronal electrodynamics involved produces a muffled signal and because the neuronal processes of interest compete with numerous other processes, from blinking to day-dreaming. One fruitful response to this noisiness has been to use stimuli with a specific frequency and to look for the signal of interest in the response at that frequency. Typically this signal involves measuring the coherence of response phase: here a Bayesian approach to measuring phase coherence is described. This Bayesian approach is illustrated using an example from neurolinguistics and is more descriptive and more data-efficient than the traditional statistical approaches.},

  abstract = {Neural oscillations are ubiquitous across recording methodologies and species, broadly associated with cognitive tasks, and amenable to computational modelling that investigates neural circuit generating mechanisms and neural population dynamics. Because of this, neural oscillations offer an exciting potential opportunity for linking theory, physiology and mechanisms of cognition. However, despite their prevalence, there are many concerns---new and old---about how our analysis assumptions are violated by known properties of field potential data. For investigations of neural oscillations to be properly interpreted, and ultimately developed into mechanistic theories, it is necessary to carefully consider the underlying assumptions of the methods we employ. Here, we discuss seven methodological considerations for analysing neural oscillations. The considerations are to (1) verify the presence of oscillations, as they may be absent; (2) validate oscillation band definitions, to address variable peak frequencies; (3) account for concurrent non-oscillatory aperiodic activity, which might otherwise confound measures; measure and account for (4) temporal variability and (5) waveform shape of neural oscillations, which are often bursty and/or nonsinusoidal, potentially leading to spurious results; (6) separate spatially overlapping rhythms, which may interfere with each other; and (7) consider the required signal-to-noise ratio for obtaining reliable estimates. For each topic, we provide relevant examples, demonstrate potential errors of interpretation, and offer suggestions to address these issues. We primarily focus on univariate measures, such as power and phase estimates, though we discuss how these issues can propagate to multivariate measures. These considerations and recommendations offer a helpful guide for measuring and interpreting neural oscillations.},

  abstract = {Neuro-electrophysiological recordings contain prominent aperiodic activity - meaning irregular activity, with no characteristic frequency - which has variously been referred to as 1/f (or 1/f-like activity), fractal, or 'scale-free' activity. Previous work has established that aperiodic features of neural activity is dynamic and variable, relating (between subjects) to healthy aging and to clinical diagnoses, and also (within subjects) tracking conscious states and behavioral performance. There are, however, a wide variety of conceptual frameworks and associated methods for the analyses and interpretation of aperiodic activity - for example, time domain measures such as the autocorrelation, fractal measures, and/or various complexity and entropy measures, as well as measures of the aperiodic exponent in the frequency domain. There is a lack of clear understanding of how these different measures relate to each other and to what extent they reflect the same or different properties of the data, which makes it difficult to synthesize results across approaches and complicates our overall understanding of the properties, biological significance, and demographic, clinical, and behavioral correlates of aperiodic neural activity. To address this problem, in this project we systematically survey the different approaches for measuring aperiodic neural activity, starting with an automated literature analysis to curate a collection of the most common methods. We then evaluate and compare these methods, using statistically representative time series simulations. In doing so, we establish consistent relationships between the measures, showing that much of what they capture reflects shared variance - though with some notable idiosyncrasies. Broadly, frequency domain methods are more specific to aperiodic features of the data, whereas time domain measures are more impacted by oscillatory activity. We extend this analysis by applying the measures to a series of empirical EEG and iEEG datasets, replicating the simulation results. We conclude by summarizing the relationships between the multiple methods, emphasizing opportunities for re-examining previous findings and for future work.},

  abstract = {The study of aperiodic neural activity -- reflecting patterns of non-frequency specific activity that are observed in electrical neural recordings such as M/EEG and intracranial LFP recordings -- has recently rapidly expanded as a topic of study. While the extent of this work reflects a newfound interest in the study of aperiodic activity, the study of aperiodic activity itself is not new. There is a rich, though arguably underappreciated, history of work developing and demonstrating key findings and ideas regarding aperiodic neural activity, dating back many decades. In addition, studies of behavior, physiology, and physics have contributed many ideas, methods, and theoretical frameworks that have informed the study of neural activity. This perspective explores the history of the study of aperiodic neural activity and related topics, covering early discussions of separating oscillatory and aperiodic activity that started in the late 1940s, the emergence of frequency-domain measures of non-frequency specific activity by the mid 1970s, and findings from across the subsequent half-century of work investigating how aperiodic neural activity relates to development, cognition, disease, and more. Collectively, this history set the foundation for key ideas regarding aperiodic activity prior to the recent (re-)emergence of these topics in contemporary work. In summarizing this historical study of aperiodic neural activity, this perspective seeks both to establish the historical context of such work as well as to emphasize the wealth of knowledge available in the historical record to contextualize and contribute to current and future work.},

  abstract = {In the study of neuro-electrophysiological recordings, aperiodic neural activity -- activity with no characteristic frequency -- has increasingly become a common feature of study. This interest has rapidly extended to clinical work, with many reports investigating aperiodic activity from patients from a broad range of clinical disorders. This work typically seeks to evaluate aperiodic activity as a putative biomarker relating to diagnosis or treatment response, and/or as a potential marker of underlying physiological activity. There is thus far no clear consensus on if and how aperiodic neural activity relates to clinical disorders, nor on the best practices for how to study it in clinical research. To address this, this systematic literature review, following PRISMA guidelines, examines reports of aperiodic activity in electrophysiological recordings with human patients with psychiatric and/or neurological disorders, finding 143 reports across 35 distinct disorders. Reports within and across disorders are summarized to evaluate current findings and examine what can be learned as pertains to the analysis, interpretations, and overall utility of aperiodic neural activity in clinical investigations. Aperiodic activity is commonly reported to relate to clinical diagnoses, with 31 of 35 disorders reporting a significant effect in diagnostic and/or treatment related studies. However, there is variation in the consistency of results across disorders, with the heterogeneity of patient groups, disease etiologies, and treatment status arising as common themes across different disorders. Overall, the current variability of results, potentially confounding covariates, and limitations in current understanding of aperiodic activity suggests further work is needed before aperiodic activity can be established as a potential biomarker and/or marker of underlying pathological physiology. Finally, a series of recommendations are proposed, based on the findings, limitations, and key discussion topics of the current literature to assist with guiding productive future work on the clinical utility of studying aperiodic neural activity.

The assessment of E/I may inform clinicians during the diagnosis and therapy management, even though it is rarely performed. An accessible measure of the E/I of the brain represents a clinically relevant feature. Here we exploited the exponent of the aperiodic component of the power spectrum of EEG signal as a noninvasive and cost-effective proxy of the E/I balance. We recorded resting-state activity with high-density EEG from 65 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and 35 controls. We extracted the exponent of the aperiodic fit of the power spectrum from source-reconstructed EEG and tested differences between TLE and controls. Spearman correlation was performed between the exponent and clinical variables (age of onset, epilepsy duration and neuropsychology) and cortical expression of epilepsy-related genes derived from Human Allen Brain Atlas. Patients with TLE showed a significantly larger exponent, corresponding to an inhibition directed E/I balance, in bilateral frontal and temporal regions. Lower E/I in the left entorhinal, and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices corresponded to a lower performance of short term verbal memory. Limited to TLE, we detected a significant correlation between the exponent and the cortical expression of GABRA1, GRIN2A, GABRD, GABRG2, KCNA2and PDYN. EEG aperiodic exponent maps the E/I balance non-invasively in patients with epilepsy and reveals a tight relationship between altered E/I patterns, cognition and genetics.},

These network activity patterns have been described across multiple animal species, brain structures, and behaviors, and are usually identified based on their spectral peak frequency. Yet, despite intensive investigation, whether gamma oscillations implement causal mechanisms of specific brain functions or represent a general dynamic mode of neural circuit operation remains unclear. In this perspective, we review recent advances in the study of gamma oscillations toward a deeper understanding of their cellular mechanisms, neural pathways, and functional roles. We discuss that a given gamma rhythm does not per se implement any specific cognitive function but rather constitutes an activity motif reporting the cellular substrates, communication channels, and computational operations underlying information processing in its generating brain circuit. Accordingly, we propose shifting the attention from a frequency-based to a circuit-level definition of gamma oscillations.},

The neurobiological mechanisms of rTMS in OCD have been incompletely characterized. We compared clinical outcomes and changes in task-based brain activation following three different rTMS stimulation protocols, all combined with exposure and response prevention (ERP). Methods In this three-arm proof-of-concept randomized trial, 61 treatment-refractory adult OCD patients received 16 sessions of rTMS immediately prior to ERP over 8 weeks, with task-based functional MRI (tb-fMRI) scans and clinical assessments pre- and post-treatment. Patients received either: high frequency (HF) rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)(n=19(6M/13F)); HF rTMS to the left pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA)(n=23(10M/13F)); or control rTMS to the vertex(n=19(6M/13F)). Changes in tb-fMRI activation pre-post treatment were compared using both a Bayesian region-of-interest and a general linear model whole-brain approach. Results Mean OCD symptom severity decreased significantly in all treatment groups (delta=-10.836, p{$<$}0.001, 95\% CI[-12.504,-9.168]), with no differences between groups. Response rate in the entire sample was 57.4\%. The DLPFC rTMS group showed decreased planning-related activation post-treatment that was associated with greater symptom improvement. No group-level activation changes were observed for the preSMA or vertex rTMS groups. Participants with greater symptom improvement in the preSMA group showed decreased error-related activation, and symptom improvement in the vertex group was associated with increased inhibition-related activation. Conclusions PreSMA and DLPFC rTMS combined with ERP led to activation decreases in targeted task networks in individuals showing greater symptom improvement, although we observed no differences in symptom reduction between groups.},

Thus, it appears as if many different gamma-band synchronization phenomena subserve many different functions. I argue that gamma-band synchronization is a fundamental process that subserves an elemental operation of cortical computation. Cortical computation unfolds in the interplay between neuronal dynamics and structural neuronal connectivity. A core motif of neuronal connectivity is convergence, which brings about both selectivity and invariance of neuronal responses. However, those core functions can be achieved simultaneously only if converging neuronal inputs are functionally segmented and if only one segment is selected at a time. This segmentation and selection can be elegantly achieved if structural connectivity interacts with neuronal synchronization. I propose that this process is at least one of the fundamental functions of gamma-band synchronization, which then subserves numerous higher cognitive functions.},

Typically, researchers study how the magnitude of the waves changes over time or how the rhythm (frequency) of the waves changes over time. The Oxford Handbook of EEG Frequency is arguably the first work to comprehensively describe the ways to study how the frequency of the waves changes over time and how changes in frequency are linked to cognitive, affective, and motor processes. Consisting of 23 chapters written by leading authorities in the field, this work is separated into three sections, with the first focusing on the basics of EEG frequency research, linking frequency analyses to core components of EEG research with event-related potential (ERP) components and local field potentials (LFPs) in non-human animals. The second section looks at specific EEG frequency components that are commonly studied using traditional frequency bands of activity to study specific psychological processes. Finally, the third section explores EEG frequency analyses in special populations and altered states. Each chapter provides a diverse perspective on the topic, giving readers the opportunity to learn about a vast array of methods to conduct EEG frequency analyses, from `traditional' to cutting-edge techniques, providing a comprehensive and in-depth overview of electroencephalography (EEG).},

  abstract = {The lack of efficacy for antipsychotics with respect to negative symptoms and cognitive deficits is a significant obstacle for the treatment of schizophrenia. Developing new drugs to target these symptoms requires appropriate neural biomarkers that can be investigated in model organisms, be used to track treatment response, and provide insight into pathophysiological disease mechanisms. A growing body of evidence indicates that neural oscillations in the gamma frequency range (30--80 Hz) are disturbed in schizophrenia. Gamma synchrony has been shown to mediate a host of sensory and cognitive functions, including perceptual encoding, selective attention, salience, and working memory -- neurocognitive processes that are dysfunctional in schizophrenia and largely refractory to treatment. This review summarizes the current state of clinical literature with respect to gamma band responses (GBRs) in schizophrenia, focusing on resting and auditory paradigms. Next, preclinical studies of schizophrenia that have investigated gamma band activity are reviewed to gain insight into neural mechanisms associated with these deficits. We conclude that abnormalities in gamma synchrony are ubiquitous in schizophrenia and likely reflect an elevation in baseline cortical gamma synchrony (`noise') coupled with reduced stimulus-evoked GBRs (`signal'). Such a model likely reflects hippocampal and cortical dysfunction, as well as reduced glutamatergic signaling with downstream GABAergic deficits, but is probably less influenced by dopaminergic abnormalities implicated in schizophrenia. Finally, we propose that analogous signal-to-noise deficits in the flow of cortical information in preclinical models are useful targets for the development of new drugs that target the treatment-resistant symptoms of schizophrenia.},

Fluctuations in E:I balance have been shown to influence neural computation, working memory, and information flow, while more drastic shifts and aberrant E:I patterns are implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders. Current methods for measuring E:I dynamics require invasive procedures that are difficult to perform in behaving animals, and nearly impossible in humans. This has limited the ability to examine the full impact that E:I shifts have in cognition and disease. In this study, we develop a computational model to show that E:I changes can be estimated from the power law exponent (slope) of the electrophysiological power spectrum. Predictions from the model are validated in published data from two species (rats and macaques). We find that reducing E:I ratio via the administration of general anesthetic in macaques results in steeper power spectra, tracking conscious state over time. This causal result is supported by inference from known anatomical E:I changes across the depth of rat hippocampus, as well as oscillatory theta-modulated dynamic shifts in E:I. Our results provide evidence that E:I ratio may be inferred from electrophysiological recordings at many spatial scales, ranging from the local field potential to surface electrocorticography. This simple method for estimating E:I ratio---one that can be applied retrospectively to existing data---removes a major hurdle in understanding a currently difficult to measure, yet fundamental, aspect of neural computation.},

  abstract = {Electrophysiological power spectra typically consist of two components: An aperiodic part usually following an 1/f power law P {$\propto$} 1/f and periodic components appearing as spectral peaks. While the investigation of the periodic parts, commonly referred to as neural oscillations, has received considerable attention, the study of the aperiodic part has only recently gained more interest. The periodic part is usually quantified by center frequencies, powers, and bandwidths, while the aperiodic part is parameterized by the y-intercept and the 1/f exponent {$\mkern1mu$}. For investigation of either part, however, it is essential to separate the two components. In this article, we scrutinize two frequently used methods, FOOOF (Fitting Oscillations \& One-Over-F) and IRASA (Irregular Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis), that are commonly used to separate the periodic from the aperiodic component. We evaluate these methods using diverse spectra obtained with electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and local field potential (LFP) recordings relating to three independent research datasets. Each method and each dataset poses distinct challenges for the extraction of both spectral parts. The specific spectral features hindering the periodic and aperiodic separation are highlighted by simulations of power spectra emphasizing these features. Through comparison with the simulation parameters defined a priori, the parameterization error of each method is quantified. Based on the real and simulated power spectra, we evaluate the advantages of both methods, discuss common challenges, note which spectral features impede the separation, assess the computational costs, and propose recommendations on how to use them.},

EEG was recorded before and after the cognitive training intervention. In both age groups, IAF (and, in a control analysis, alpha amplitude) did not change, despite large gains in cognitive performance. As within-session reliability and test-retest stability were high for both age groups, imprecise measurements cannot account for the findings. In sum, IAF is highly stable in healthy adults up to 80 years, not easily modifiable by cognitive interventions alone, and thus qualifies as a stable neurophysiological trait marker.},

Here, we systematically studied variability in posterior alpha peak frequency both between and within subjects. We recorded brain activity using MEG in 51 healthy human subjects under three experimental conditions --- rest, passive visual stimulation and an N-back working memory paradigm, using source reconstruction methods to separate alpha activity from parietal and occipital sources. We asked how alpha peak frequency differed within subjects across cognitive conditions and regions of interest, and looked at the distribution of alpha peak frequency between subjects. In both regions we observed an increase of alpha peak frequency from resting state and passive visual stimulation conditions to the N-back paradigm, with a significantly higher alpha peak frequency in the 2-back compared to the 0-back condition. There was a trend for a greater increase in alpha peak frequency during the N-back task in the occipital vs. parietal cortex. The average alpha peak frequency across all subjects, conditions, and regions of interest was 10.3 Hz with a within-subject SD of 0.9 Hz and a between-subject SD of 2.8 Hz. We also measured beta peak frequencies, and except in the parietal cortex during rest, found no indication of a strictly harmonic relationship with alpha peak frequencies. We conclude that alpha peak frequency in posterior regions increases with increasing cognitive demands, and that the alpha rhythm operates across a wider frequency range than the 8--12 Hz band many studies tend to include in their analysis. Thus, using a fixed and limited alpha frequency band might bias results against certain subjects and conditions.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Recent years of research have shown that the complex temporal structure of ongoing oscillations is scale-free and characterized by long-range temporal correlations. Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) has proven particularly useful, revealing that genetic variation, normal development, or disease can lead to differences in the scale-free amplitude modulation of oscillations. Furthermore, amplitude dynamics is remarkably independent of the time-averaged oscillation power, indicating that the DFA provides unique insights into the functional organization of neuronal systems. To facilitate understanding and encourage wider use of scaling analysis of neuronal oscillations, we provide a pedagogical explanation of the DFA algorithm and its underlying theory. Practical advice on applying DFA to oscillations is supported by MATLAB scripts from the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox (NBT) and links to the NBT tutorial website {$<$}uri xlink:href="http://www.nbtwiki.net/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"{$>$}http://www.nbtwiki.net/{$<$}/uri{$>$}.

Current-day neuromagnetometers house hundreds of SQUIDs, superconducting quantum interference devices, to pick up signals generated by concerted action of cortical neurons. Complementary MEG measures of neuronal involvement include evoked responses, modulation of cortical rhythms, properties of the on-going neural activity, and interareal connectivity. Future MEG breakthroughs in understanding brain dynamics are expected through advanced signal analysis and combined use of MEG with hemodynamic imaging (fMRI).

Supporting this, abnormalities in gamma oscillations have been reported in patients with diverse neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders in which cognitive impair\- ment is prominent. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning this relationship is the focus of extensive research. But while an increasing number of studies are investigating the intricate relationship between gamma oscillations and cognition, interpretation and generalisation of these studies is limited by the diverse, and at times questionable, methodologies used to analyse oscillatory activity. For example, a variety of different types of gamma oscillatory activity have been characterised, but all are generalised non-specifically as `gamma oscilla\- tions'. This creates confusion, since distinct cellular and network mechanisms are likely responsible for gener\- ating these different types of rhythm. Moreover, in some instances, certain analytical measures of electrophysiological data are overinterpreted, with researchers pushing the boundaries of what would be considered rhythmic or oscillatory in nature. Here, we provide clarity on these issues, firstly presenting an overview of the different measures of gamma oscillatory activity, and describing common signal processing techniques used for analysis. Limitations of these techniques are discussed, and recommendations made on how future studies should optimise analyses, presentation and interpretation of gamma frequency oscillations. This is an essential progression in order to harmonise future studies, allowing us to gain a clearer understanding of the role of gamma oscillations in cognition, and in cognitive disorders.},

  abstract = {Healthy and successful living involves carefully navigating rewarding and threatening situations by balancing approach and avoidance behaviours. Excessive avoidance to evade potential threats often leads to forfeiting potential rewards. However, little is known about how reward and threat information is integrated neurally to inform approach or avoidance decisions. In this preregistered study, participants (Nbehaviour=31, 17F; NMRI=28, 15F) made approach-avoidance decisions under varying reward (monetary gains) and threat (electrical stimulations) prospects during functional MRI scanning. In contrast to theorized parallel subcortical processing of reward and threat information before cortical integration, Bayesian Multivariate Multilevel analyses revealed subcortical reward and threat integration prior to indicating approach-avoidance decisions. This integration occurred in the ventral striatum, thalamus, and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). When reward was low, risk-diminishing avoidance decisions dominated, which was linked to more positive tracking of threat magnitude prior to indicating avoidance than approach decisions across these regions. In contrast, the amygdala exhibited dual sensitivity to reward and threat. While anticipating outcomes of risky approach decisions, we observed positive tracking of threat magnitude within the salience network (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, thalamus, periaqueductal gray, BNST). Conversely, after risk-diminishing avoidance, characterized by reduced reward prospects, we observed more negative tracking of reward magnitude in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum. These findings shed light on the temporal dynamics of approach-avoidance decision-making. Importantly, they demonstrate the role of subcortical integration of reward and threat information in balancing approach and avoidance, challenging theories positing predominantly separate subcortical processing prior to cortical integration.},

Several implementations of such binding have been proposed in the literature, most prominently synaptic binding (learning) and synchronization. Biologically plausible accounts of how these different types of binding interact in the human brain are still lacking. To this end, we adopt a computational approach to investigate the impact of learning and synchronization on both behavioral (reaction time, error rate) and neural ({\texttheta} power) measures. We train four models varying in their ability to learn and synchronize for an extended period of time on three seminal action control paradigms varying in difficulty. Learning, but not synchronization, proved essential for behavioral improvement. Synchronization however boosts performance of difficult tasks, avoiding the computational pitfalls of catastrophic interference. At the neural level, {\texttheta} power decreases with practice but increases with task difficulty. Our simulation results bring new insights in how different types of binding interact in different types of tasks, and how this is translated in both behavioral and neural metrics.},

  abstract = {Abstract             For most of the twentieth century through to the present day, statistics has been neatly divided into two theoretical frameworks: classical/frequentist and Bayesian. Scientists typically choose the statistical theoretical framework to analyze their data depending on the nature and complexity of the problem, and based on their personal views on probability and uncertainty. While textbooks and courses should reflect and anticipate this dual reality, they rarely do so. Scientists needing to employ the alternative statistical framework almost need to relearn from scratch. This book explains, discusses, and applies both the classical/frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks to fit the different types of generalized linear mixed models that allow the analysis of the types of data commonly gathered by researchers in the life sciences, incorporating the experimental or survey design, or, more generally, features of the data collection process. It presents material in an intuitive, approachable, and progressive manner suitable for research scientists and graduate students with only a very basic knowledge of calculus and statistics. The book covers the material in a theoretically rigorous manner, focusing on the practical application of all the methods to actual research data.},

  abstract = {The auditory steady state response (ASSR) arises when periodic sounds evoke stable responses in auditory networks that reflect the acoustic characteristics of the stimuli, such as the amplitude of the sound envelope. Larger for some stimulus rates than others, the ASSR in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) is notably maximal for sounds modulated in amplitude at 40 Hz. To investigate the local circuit underpinnings of the large ASSR to 40 Hz amplitude-modulated (AM) sounds, we acquired skull EEG and local field potential (LFP) recordings from primary auditory cortex (A1) in the rat during the presentation of 20, 30, 40, 50, and 80 Hz AM tones. 40 Hz AM tones elicited the largest ASSR from the EEG acquired above auditory cortex and the LFP acquired from each cortical layer in A1. The large ASSR in the EEG to 40 Hz AM tones was not due to larger instantaneous amplitude of the signals or to greater phase alignment of the LFP across the cortical layers. Instead, it resulted from decreased latency variability (or enhanced temporal consistency) of the 40 Hz response. Statistical models indicate the EEG signal was best predicted by LFPs in either the most superficial or deep cortical layers, suggesting deep layer coordinators of the ASSR. Overall, our results indicate that the recruitment of non-uniform but more temporally consistent responses across A1 layers underlie the larger ASSR to amplitude-modulated tones at 40 Hz.},

Factors such as education, literacy, lifestyle, and social networking are usually considered to be proxies of CR and its variability between individuals. A more direct approach to examine CR is through the assessment of capacity to gain from practice in a standardized challenging cognitive task that demands activation of cognitive resources. In this study, we applied a testing-the-limits paradigm to a group of 136 healthy elderly subjects (60\&ndash;75 years) and additionally examined the possible contribution of complex mental activities and quality of sleep to cognitive performance gain. We found a significant but variable gain and identified verbal memory, cognitive flexibility, and problem-solving as important factors. This outcome is in line with our earlier study on CR in healthy mental aging. Interestingly and contrary to expectations, our analysis revealed that complex mental activities and sleep quality do not significantly influence CR. Best subset regression showed that better verbal memory and higher cognitive flexibility were related to high CR, which could also be seen when contrasting \&ldquo;high\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;low\&rdquo; cognitive performers; again, complex mental activities and sleep quality did not contribute to this measure of CR. In conclusion, the results of this study support and extend previous findings on CR in older age; further, they underline the need for improvements in existing protocols for assessing CR in a dynamic manner.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The primary purpose of this article is to review recent studies using chaos theory and nonlinear dynamical methods to analyze human performance in different brain processes. (2) Methods: Several studies have examined chaos theory and related analytical tools for describing brain dynamics. The present study provides an in-depth analysis of the computational methods that have been proposed to uncover brain dynamics. (3) Results: The evidence from 55 articles suggests that cognitive function is more frequently assessed than other brain functions in studies using chaos theory. The most frequently used techniques for analyzing chaos include the correlation dimension and fractal analysis. Approximate, Kolmogorov and sample entropy account for the largest proportion of entropy algorithms in the reviewed studies. (4) Conclusions: This review provides insights into the notion of the brain as a chaotic system and the successful use of nonlinear methods in neuroscience studies. Additional studies of brain dynamics would aid in improving our understanding of human cognitive performance.},

We investigated whether rhythmic brain activity in these areas is characteristic and can be used for automatic classification. To this end, resting-state MEG data of 22 healthy adults was analysed. Power spectra of 1-s long data segments for atlas-defined brain areas were clustered into spectral profiles (``fingerprints''), using k-means and Gaussian mixture (GM) modelling. We demonstrate that individual areas can be identified from these spectral profiles with high accuracy. Our results suggest that each brain area engages in different spectral modes that are characteristic for individual areas. Clustering of brain areas according to similarity of spectral profiles reveals well-known brain networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate task-specific modulations of auditory spectral profiles during auditory processing. These findings have important implications for the classification of regional spectral activity and allow for novel approaches in neuroimaging and neurostimulation in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Do humans perceive the world through discrete sampling of the sensory environment? Although it contrasts starkly with the intuition of a continuous perceptual flow, this idea dates back decades when brain rhythms were first suggested to work as periodic shutters. These would gate bouts of information into conscious perception and affect behavioural responses to sensory events. Seminal experimental findings have since largely confirmed brain rhythms as the neural implementation of periodic sampling. However, novel methods, improved experimental designs, and innovative analytical approaches show that the exact roles and functional significance of rhythmic brain activity for cognition remain to be determined. In re-visiting the evidence for rhythmic sampling, the contributions to this Special Issue gave a mixed picture: Studies testing for rhythmic patterns in behavioural performance largely supported the notion. However, at odds with previous results, most attempts to link behavioural outcomes with the phase of neural rhythms did not find supporting evidence. Also, contrasting earlier results, studies that used external sensory or electrical stimulation to control neural phase (`entrainment') failed to find support for rhythmic sampling in behavioural performance despite other research, included here, that reported neural indicators of entrainment. This Special Issue therefore points out interesting divides in the study of rhythmic sampling across different domains and highlights the importance of publishing negative findings and replications to improve our understanding of the role of rhythms in cognition.},

Herein, we recorded the ASSR from humans, rhesus monkeys, and marmosets using the same method to directly compare the characteristics of ASSRs among the species. We used auditory trains on a wide range of frequencies to investigate the suitable frequency for ASSRs induction, because monkeys usually use stimulus frequency ranges different from humans for vocalization. We found that monkeys and marmosets also show auditory event-related potentials and phase-locking activity in gamma-frequency trains, although the optimal frequency with the best synchronization differed among these species. These results suggest that the ASSR could be a useful translational, cross-species biomarker to examine the generation of gamma-band synchronization in nonhuman primate models of schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Gamma entrainment has been shown to enhance beta amyloid (A{$\beta$}) uptake in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as improve cognitive symptoms of dementia in both humans and mice. Similar improvements have been reported for both invasive and non-invasive brain stimulation in the gamma oscillatory band, with 40~Hz auditory and visual sensory stimulants employed in non-invasive approaches. Non-invasive stimulation techniques possess the clear advantage of not requiring surgical procedures and can hence be applicable to a wider set of patients. The dataset introduced here was acquired with the aim of examining the network-level mechanisms governing the production of the brain's oscillatory activity during non-invasive auditory gamma-band stimulation, and thereby helping to explain the reported therapeutic effects of entrainment in AD patients. Thirteen elderly participants with memory complaints whose conditions were diagnosed as normal aging (non-AD) or mild AD based on the standard criteria for the diagnosis of AD including the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) took part in data collection in which EEG signals were recorded during auditory stimulation of the brain. The data collection session consisted of an initial one-minute rest followed by an alternating set of six stimulation trials interleaved with five rest trials. During each stimulation trial, an auditory stimulant in the form of a 40~Hz chirp was presented to the participant. The collected data from all participants were preprocessed following the full pipeline of Makoto with the use of EEGLAB and posted as a dataset named: Auditory Gamma Entrainment at OpenNeuro repository. The data record for each participant includes the EEG signal represented in standard BIDS format for one-minute rest followed by the auditory task data. A copy of the source EEG data is also provided in .txt format. The dataset can be used to study the characteristics of brain oscillations during entrainment, as well as for studies on auditory perception, analysis of resting state potentials in dementia patients, comparison of auditory evoked potentials with resting state potentials, ERP, ERSP, and SSAVP analysis of auditory response in dementia patients, time series analysis of the stimulation and rest trials, and brain connectivity analysis in dementia patients.},

Non-pharmaceutical treatments for dementia have recently explored interventions involving the stimulation of neuronal populations in the gamma band. These interventions aim to restore brain network functionality by synchronizing rhythmic energy through various stimulation modalities. Entrainment, a newly proposed non-invasive sensory stimulation method, has shown promise in improving cognitive functions in dementia patients. This study investigates the effectiveness of entrainment in terms of promoting neural synchrony and spatial connectivity across the cortex. EEG signals were recorded during a 40~Hz auditory entrainment session conducted with a group of elderly participants with dementia. Phase locking value (PLV) between different intraregional and interregional~sites was examined as an attribute of network synchronization, and connectivity of local and distant links were compared during the stimulation and rest trials. Our findings demonstrate enhanced neural synchrony between the frontal and parietal regions, which are key components of the brain's default mode network (DMN). The DMN operation is known to be impacted by dementia's progression, leading to reduced functional connectivity across the parieto-frontal pathways. Notably, entrainment alone significantly improves synchrony between these DMN components, suggesting its potential for restoring functional connectivity.},

  abstract = {Rhythms are a fundamental and defining feature of neuronal activity in animals including humans. This rhythmic brain activity interacts in complex ways with rhythms in the internal and external environment through the phenomenon of `neuronal entrainment', which is attracting increasing attention due to its suggested role in a multitude of sensory and cognitive processes. Some senses, such as touch and vision, sample the environment rhythmically, while others, like audition, are faced with mostly rhythmic inputs. Entrainment couples rhythmic brain activity to external and internal rhythmic events, serving fine-grained routing and modulation of external and internal signals across multiple spatial and temporal hierarchies. This interaction between a brain and its environment can be experimentally investigated and even modified by rhythmic sensory stimuli or invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation techniques. We provide a comprehensive overview of the topic and propose a theoretical framework of how neuronal entrainment dynamically structures information from incoming neuronal, bodily and environmental sources. We discuss the different types of neuronal entrainment, the conceptual advances in the field, and converging evidence for general principles.},

  abstract = {The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is increasingly being used as a biomarker in neuropsychiatric disorders, but research investigating the test-retest reliability of this measure is needed. We previously reported ASSR reliability, measured by electroencephalography (EEG), to 40Hz amplitude-modulated white noise and click train stimuli. The purpose of the current study was to (a) assess the reliability of the MEG-measured ASSR to 40Hz amplitude-modulated white noise and click train stimuli, and (b) compare test-retest reliability between MEG and EEG measures of ASSR, which has not previously been investigated. Additionally, impact of stimulus parameter choice on reliability was assessed, by comparing responses to white noise and click train stimuli. Test-retest reliability, across sessions approximately one week apart, was assessed in 17 healthy adults. On each study day, participants completed two passive listening tasks (white noise and click train stimuli) during separate MEG and EEG recordings. Between-session correlations for evoked power and inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) were assessed following source-space projection. Overall, the MEG-measured ASSR was significantly correlated between sessions (p{$<$}0.05, FDR corrected), suggesting acceptable test-retest reliability. Results suggest greater response reproducibility for ITPC compared to evoked responses and for click train compared to white noise stimuli, although further study is warranted. No significant differences in reliability were observed between MEG and EEG measures, suggesting they are similarly reliable. This work supports use of the ASSR as a biomarker in clinical interventions with repeated measures.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Turmoil has engulfed psychological science. Causes and consequences of the reproducibility crisis are in dispute. With the hope of addressing some of its aspects, Bayesian methods are gaining increasing attention in psychological science. Some of their advantages, as opposed to the frequentist framework, are the ability to describe parameters in probabilistic terms and explicitly incorporate prior knowledge about them into the model. These issues are crucial in particular regarding the current debate about statistical significance. Bayesian methods are not necessarily the only remedy against incorrect interpretations or wrong conclusions, but there is an increasing agreement that they are one of the keys to avoid such fallacies. Nevertheless, its flexible nature is its power and weakness, for there is no agreement about what indices of ``significance'' should be computed or reported. This lack of a consensual index or guidelines, such as the frequentist {$<$}italic{$>$}p{$<$}/italic{$>$}-value, further contributes to the unnecessary opacity that many non-familiar readers perceive in Bayesian statistics. Thus, this study describes and compares several Bayesian indices, provide intuitive visual representation of their ``behavior'' in relationship with common sources of variance such as sample size, magnitude of effects and also frequentist significance. The results contribute to the development of an intuitive understanding of the values that researchers report, allowing to draw sensible recommendations for Bayesian statistics description, critical for the standardization of scientific reporting.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is an oscillatory brain response generated by periodic auditory stimuli and originates mainly from the temporal auditory cortices. Recent data show that while the auditory cortices are indeed strongly activated by the stimulus when it is present (ON ASSR), the anatomical distribution of ASSR sources involves also parietal and frontal cortices, indicating that the ASSR is a more complex phenomenon than previously believed. Furthermore, while the ASSR typically continues to oscillate even after the stimulus has stopped (OFF ASSR), very little is known about the characteristics of the OFF ASSR and how it compares to the ON ASSR. Here, we assessed whether the OFF and ON ASSR powers are modulated by the stimulus properties (i.e. volume and pitch), selective attention, as well as individual musical sophistication. We also investigated the cortical source distribution of the OFF ASSR using a melody tracking task, in which attention was directed between uniquely amplitude-modulated melody streams that differed in pitch. The ON and OFF ASSRs were recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) on a group of participants varying from low to high degree of musical sophistication. Our results show that the OFF ASSR is different from the ON ASSR in nearly every aspect. While the ON ASSR was modulated by the stimulus properties and selective attention, the OFF ASSR was not influenced by any of these factors. Furthermore, while the ON ASSR was generated primarily from temporal sources, the OFF ASSR originated mainly from the frontal cortex. These findings challenge the notion that the OFF ASSR is merely a continuation of the ON ASSR. Rather, they suggest that the OFF ASSR is an internally-driven signal that develops from an initial sensory processing state (ON ASSR), with both types of ASSRs clearly differing in cortical representation and character. Furthermore, our results show that the ON ASSR power was enhanced by selective attention at cortical sources within each of the bilateral frontal, temporal, parietal and insular lobes. Finally, the ON ASSR proved sensitive to musicality, demonstrating positive correlations between musical sophistication and ASSR power, as well as with the degree of attentional ASSR modulation at the left and right parietal cortices. Taken together, these results show new aspects of the ASSR response, and demonstrate its usefulness as an effective tool for analysing how selective attention interacts with individual abilities in music perception.},

  abstract = {Many important questions in neuroscience are about interactions between neurons or neuronal groups. These interactions are often quantified by coherence, which is a frequency-indexed measure that quantifies the extent to which two signals exhibit a consistent phase relation. In this paper, we consider the statistical testing of the difference between coherence values observed in two experimental conditions. We pay special attention to problems induced by (1) unequal sample sizes and (2) the fact that coherence is typically evaluated at a large number of frequency bins and between large numbers of pairs of neurons or neuronal groups (the multiple comparisons problem). We show that nonparametric statistical tests provide convincing and elegant solutions for both problems. We also show that these tests allow to incorporate biophysically motivated constraints in the test statistic, which may drastically increase the sensitivity of the test. Finally, we explain why the nonparametric test is formally correct. This means that we formulate a null hypothesis (identical probability distribution in the different experimental conditions) and show that the nonparametric test controls the false alarm rate under this null hypothesis. The proposed methodology is illustrated by analyses of data collected in a study on cortico-spinal coherence [Schoffelen JM, Oostenveld R, Fries P. Neuronal coherence as a mechanism of effective corticospinal interaction. Science 2005;308(5718):111-3].},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION Accumulation and interaction of amyloid-beta (A{$\beta$}) and tau proteins during progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are shown to tilt neuronal circuits away from balanced excitation/inhibition (E/I). Current available techniques for noninvasive interrogation of E/I in the intact human brain, for example, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), are highly restrictive (i.e., limited spatial extent), have low temporal and spatial resolution and suffer from the limited ability to distinguish accurately between different neurotransmitters complicating its interpretation. As such, these methods alone offer an incomplete explanation of E/I. Recently, the aperiodic component of neural power spectrum, often referred to in the literature as the `1/f slope', has been described as a promising and scalable biomarker that can track disruptions in E/I potentially underlying a spectrum of clinical conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, or epilepsy, as well as developmental E/I changes as seen in aging. METHODS Using 1/f slopes from resting-state spectral data and computational modeling, we developed a new method for inferring E/I alterations in AD. RESULTS We tested our method on recent freely and publicly available electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) datasets of patients with AD or prodromal disease and demonstrated the method's potential for uncovering regional patterns of abnormal excitatory and inhibitory parameters. DISCUSSION Our results provide a general framework for investigating circuit-level disorders in AD and developing therapeutic interventions that aim to restore the balance between excitation and inhibition.},

However, the variability in both brain and behavioral responses to tDCS limits its application for clinical purposes. This study aims to shed light on state-dependency, a phenomenon that contributes to the variability of tDCS. Methods To this aim, we investigated changes in spectral activity and functional connectivity in somatomotor regions after Real and Sham tDCS using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), which allowed us to investigate how modulation depends on the initial state of the brain. Results Results showed that changes in spectral activity, but not connectivity, in the somatomotor regions depend on the initial state of the brain, confirming state-dependent effects. Specifically, we found a non-linear interaction between stimulation conditions (Real vs. Sham) and initial state: a reduction of alpha and beta power was observed only in participants that had higher alpha and beta power before Real tDCS. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of considering state-dependency to tDCS and shows how it can be taken into account with appropriate statistical models. Significance Our findings bear insight into tDCS mechanisms, potentially leading to discriminate between tDCS responders and non-responders.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the consistency of the auditory steady-state response (ASSR) across sessions. Furthermore, the current study aimed to investigate how the reliability of the ASSR is impacted by stimulus parameters and analysis method employed. The consistency of this response across two sessions spaced approximately 1 week apart was measured in nineteen healthy adults using electroencephalography (EEG). The ASSR was entrained by both 40 Hz amplitude-modulated white noise and click train stimuli. Correlations between sessions were assessed with two separate analytical techniques: a) channel-level analysis across the whole-head array and b) signal-space projection from auditory dipoles. Overall, the ASSR was significantly correlated between sessions 1 and 2 (p{$<$}0.05, multiple comparison corrected), suggesting adequate test-retest reliability of this response. The current study also suggests that measures of inter-trial phase coherence may be more reliable between sessions than measures of evoked power. Results were similar between the two analysis methods, but reliability varied depending on the presented stimulus, with click train stimuli producing more consistent responses than white noise stimuli.},

Here we analyzed the relation between 1/f slope and LZc with two in-silico approaches and in both rat EEG and monkey ECoG data. We contrasted resting state with propofol anesthesia, which directly modulates the excitation-inhibition balance. We found convergent results among simulated and empirical data, showing a strong, inverse and non trivial monotonic relation between 1/f slope and complexity, consistent at both ECoG and EEG scales.

While recent efforts have led to the development of methods for decomposing spectral data, challenges remain in performing statistical analysis and group-level comparisons. Here, we introduce Bayesian spectral decomposition (BSD), a Bayesian framework for analysing neural spectral power. BSD allows for the specification, inversion, comparison and analysis of parametric models of neural spectra, addressing limitations of existing methods. We first establish the face validity of BSD on simulated data and show how it outperforms an established method [fit oscillations and one-over-               f               (FOOOF)] for peak detection on artificial spectral data. We then demonstrate the efficacy of BSD on a group-level study of electroencephalography (EEG) spectra in 204 healthy subjects from the LEMON dataset. Our results not only highlight the effectiveness of BSD in model selection and parameter estimation but also illustrate how BSD enables straightforward group-level regression of the effect of continuous covariates such as age. By using Bayesian inference techniques, BSD provides a robust framework for studying neural spectral data and their relationship to brain function and dysfunction.},

Accordingly, monitoring excitability and controlling its degree using antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is of prime importance for clinical care and treatment. To date, adequate measures of excitability and action of AEDs have been difficult to identify. Recent insights into ongoing cortical activity have identified global levels of phase synchronization as measures that characterize normal levels of excitability and quantify any deviation therefrom. Here, we explore the usefulness of these intrinsic measures to quantify cortical excitability in humans. First, we observe a correlation of such markers with stimulation-evoked responses suggesting them to be viable excitability measures based on ongoing activity. Second, we report a significant covariation with the level of AED load and a wake-dependent modulation. Our results indicate that excitability in epileptic networks is effectively reduced by AEDs and suggest the proposed markers as useful candidates to quantify excitability in routine clinical conditions overcoming the limitations of electrical or magnetic stimulation. The wake-dependent time course of these metrics suggests a homeostatic role of sleep, to rebalance cortical excitability.},

The underlying circuit mechanism, however, remains poorly understood and represents a major challenge in neuroscience. In the present work we tackled this problem using a large-scale computational model of the primate cortex constrained by new directed and weighted connectivity data. In our model, the interplay between feedforward and feedback signaling depends on the cortical laminar structure and involves complex dynamics across multiple (intra-laminar, inter-laminar, inter-areal and whole cortex) scales. The model was tested by reproducing, and shedding insights into, a wide range of neurophysiological findings about frequency-dependent interactions between visual cortical areas: feedforward pathways are associated with enhanced gamma (30-70 Hz) oscillations, whereas feedback projections selectively modulate alpha/low beta (8-15 Hz) oscillations. We found that in order for the model to account for the experimental observations, the feedback projection needs to predominantly target infragranular layers in a target area, which leads to a proposed circuit substrate for predictive coding. The model reproduces a functional hierarchy based on frequency-dependent Granger causality analysis of inter-areal signaling, as reported in recent monkey and human experiments. Taken together, this work highlights the importance of multi-scale approaches and provides a modeling platform for studies of large-scale brain circuit dynamics and functions.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have identified broadband phenomena in the electric potentials produced by the brain. We report the finding of power-law scaling in these signals using subdural electrocorticographic recordings from the surface of human cortex. The power spectral density (PSD) of the electric potential has the power-law form from 80 to 500 Hz. This scaling index, , is conserved across subjects, area in the cortex, and local neural activity levels. The shape of the PSD does not change with increases in local cortical activity, but the amplitude, , increases. We observe a ``knee'' in the spectra at , implying the existence of a characteristic time scale . Below , we explore two-power-law forms of the PSD, and demonstrate that there are activity-related fluctuations in the amplitude of a power-law process lying beneath the rhythms. Finally, we illustrate through simulation how, small-scale, simplified neuronal models could lead to these power-law observations. This suggests a new paradigm of non-oscillatory ``asynchronous,'' scale-free, changes in cortical potentials, corresponding to changes in mean population-averaged firing rate, to complement the prevalent ``synchronous'' rhythm-based paradigm.},

  abstract = {Objective Examining the size and reactivity of the pupils of traumatic brain injury coma patients is fundamental in the Neuro-intensive care unit (ICU). Pupil parameters on admission predict long-term clinical outcomes. However, little is known about the dynamics of pupillary parameters and their potential value for outcome prediction. Methods This study applied a time-course analysis of pupillary signals (size and photo-reactivity) in acute traumatic brain injury coma patients (n = 20) to predict outcome at 6 months. Results The time course of pupillary signals was informative in discriminating favorable (F) versus unfavorable (U) outcomes, with the highest correlation within the 1st week notwithstanding pharmacological sedation. Patients with favorable outcome at 6 months showed more consistent in time isochoric and photo-reactive pupils. In contrast, patients with an unfavorable outcome showed more variable measures that tended to stabilize toward pathological values. Interpretation Time-dependent tracking of pupils' size and reactivity is a promising application for ICU monitoring and long-term prognosis. These findings support the usefulness of automatic tools for the dynamic, quantitative, and objective measurements of pupils.},

  abstract = {Simultaneous EEG-fMRI is a growing and promising field, as it has great potential to further our understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of brain function in health and disease. In particular, there is much interest in understanding the fMRI correlates of brain activity in the gamma band ({$>~$}30~Hz), as these frequencies are thought to be associated with cognitive processes involving perception, attention, and memory, as well as with disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. However, progress in this area has been limited due to issues such as MR-induced artifacts in EEG recordings, which seem to be more problematic for gamma frequencies. This paper presents a noise removal method for the gamma band of EEG that is based on the Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA), but with a new implementation strategy. HHSA uses a nested empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to identify amplitude and frequency modulations (AM and FM, respectively) by averaging over frequencies with high and significant powers. Our method examines gamma band by applying two layers of EMD to the FM and AM components, removing components with very low power based on the power-instantaneous frequency spectrum, and subsequently reconstructs the denoised gamma-band signal from the remaining components. Simulations demonstrate that our proposed method efficiently reduces artifacts while preserving the original gamma signal which is especially critical for simultaneous EEG/fMRI studies.},

Both packages are integrated with other well-established R packages, which allows great flexibility. In this Tutorial, we describe the main data and functions in the ggseg and ggseg3d packages for visualization of brain atlases. The highlighted functions are able to display brain-segmentation plots in R. Further, the accompanying ggsegExtra package includes a wider collection of atlases and is intended for community-based efforts to develop additional compatible atlases for ggseg and ggseg3d. Overall, the ggseg packages facilitate parcellation-based visualizations in R, improve and facilitate the dissemination of results, and increase the efficiency of workflows.},

  abstract = {Good Scientific Practice (GSP) refers to both explicit and implicit rules or guidelines that help scientists to produce work that is of the highest quality at any given time, and to efficiently share that work with the community for further scrutiny or utilization. For experimental research using magneto- and electroencephalography (MEEG), GSP includes specific standards and guidelines for technical competence, which are periodically updated whenever new findings come to light. However, GSP also needs to be periodically revisited in a broader light. At the LiveMEEG 2020 conference, a reflection on GSP was fostered that included explicitly documented guidelines and technical advances, but also emphasised intangible GSP: a general awareness of personal, organisational, and societal realities and how they can influence MEEG research. This article provides an extensive report on most of the LiveMEEG contributions and new literature, with the additional aim to synthesize ongoing cultural changes in GSP. It first covers GSP with respect to cognitive biases and logical fallacies, pre-registration as a tool to avoid those and other early pitfalls, and a number of resources to enable collaborative and reproducible research as a general approach to minimize misconceptions. Second, GSP with respect to data acquisition, analysis, reporting, and sharing is discussed, including new tools and frameworks to support collaborative work. Finally, GSP is considered in light of ethical implications of MEEG research and the resulting responsibility that scientists have to engage with societal challenges. Considering among other things the benefits of peer review and open access at all stages, the need to coordinate larger international projects, the complexity of MEEG subject matter, and today's prioritization of fairness, privacy, and the environment, we find that current GSP tends to favour collective and cooperative work, for both scientific and for societal reasons.},

This study aimed to provide more conclusive evidence. EEG was recorded during three resting state sessions, a vigilance session, and a short-term visual memory task. Six respective IAF estimates were calculated for a total of 153 participants. Participants also completed the battery of 17 tests measuring four main dimensions of cognitive ability: fluid reasoning, working memory, visual discrimination, and processing speed. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the factors reflecting fluid reasoning, working memory, and visual discrimination, as well as the higherorder factor reflecting general intelligence, were unrelated to the IAF factor. At the same time, IAF positively correlated with processing speed, sharing 5.5\% of variance. The EEG findings were replicated in another sample (N = 94) using MEG data and a different cognitive-ability assessment. Overall, the study implies that brains with higher IAFs do run faster, but it does not make them smarter. The study clarifies the so far equivocal relationship between the individual frequency of the dominating alpha rhythm and cognitive functioning.},

In particular, we propose an adaptive version of a well-known metric of feature importance, named Leave One Covariate Out (LOCO), to disentangle high-order effects involving a given input feature in regression problems. LOCO is the reduction of the prediction error when the feature under consideration is added to the set of all the features used for regression. Instead of calculating the LOCO using all the features at hand, as in its standard version, our method searches for the multiplet of features that maximize LOCO and for the one that minimize it. This provides a decomposition of the LOCO as the sum of a two-body component and higher-order components (redundant and synergistic), also highlighting the features that contribute to building these high-order effects alongside the driving feature. We report the application to proton/pion discrimination from simulated detector measures by GEANT.},

In this paper, we discuss why parameterization is an imperative step for developmental cognitive neuroscientists interested in cognition and behavior across the lifespan, as well as how this can be readily accomplished with an automated spectral parameterization (``specparam'') algorithm (Donoghue et al., 2020a). We provide annotated code for power spectral parameterization, via specparam, in Jupyter Notebook and R Studio. We then apply this algorithm to EEG data in childhood (N = 60; Mage = 10.80, SD = 1.00) to illustrate its utility for developmental cognitive neuroscientists. Ultimately, explicit parameterization of neural power spectra may help us refine our understanding of how dynamic neural communication contributes to normative and aberrant cognition across the lifespan.

Conclusions: All the reviewed studies focused on exploring the pathophysiological significance of the aperiodic component and its correlation with disease presence, stage, and severity. Despite the heterogeneity of pathologies, it was possible to cluster most of them according to the mechanism underlying slope alterations, namely hypo-/hyper-excitability. It was also possible to identify some counterintuitive findings, probably related to compensation mechanisms of disease-specific neurophysiological alterations.},

Gamma-range ASSRs are utilized to observe the dysfunctions of brain-synchronization abilities in neuropsychiatric and developmental disorders with cognitive symptoms. However, the link between gamma-range ASSRs and cognitive functioning is not clear. We systematically reviewed existing findings on the associations between gamma-range ASSRs and cognitive functions in patients with neuropsychiatric or developmental disorders and healthy subjects. The literature search yielded 1597 articles. After excluding duplicates and assessing eligibility, 22 articles were included. In healthy participants, the gamma-range ASSR was related to cognitive flexibility and reasoning as measured by complex tasks and behavioral indicators of processing speed. In patients with schizophrenia, the studies that reported correlations found a higher ASSR to be accompanied by better performance on short-term memory tasks, long-term/semantic memory, and simple speeded tasks. The main findings indicate that individual differences in the gamma-range ASSR reflect the level of attentional control and the ability to temporary store and manipulate the information, which are necessary for a wide range of complex cognitive activities, including language, in both healthy and impaired populations.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The slope of the electroencephalography (EEG) power spectrum (also referred to as 1/f noise) is an important consideration when calculating narrow-band power. However, psychophysiological data also suggest this slope is a meaningful signal itself, not merely background activity or noise. We present two different methods for quantifying the slope of the power spectrum and assess their reliability and sensitivity. Methods: We used data from N = 60 participants who had EEG collected during rest, a videogame task, and a second period of rest. At all phases of the experiment, we calculated the ``spectral slope'' (a regression-based method fit to all datapoints) and the ``aperiodic slope'' (estimated with the fitting oscillations with 1/f algo\- rithm FOOOF). For both methods we assessed: their reliability, their sensitivity to the transition from rest to task, their sensitivity to changes during the videogame task itself, and the agreement between the two measures. Results: Across resting phases, both spectral and aperiodic slopes showed a high degree of reliability. Both methods also showed a steepening of the power spectrum on-task compared to rest. There was also a high degree of consistency between the two methods in their estimate of the underlying slope, but FOOOF explained more variance in the power spectra across regions and type of activity (rest versus task). Conclusion: The slope of the power spectrum is a highly reliable individual difference and sensitive to withinsubject changes across two different methods of estimation. Moving forward, we generally recommend the use of the FOOOF algorithm for its ability to account for narrow-band signals, but these data show how regression-based approaches produce similar estimates of the spectral slope, which may be useful in some applications.},

  abstract = {Background The outcome of stroke survivors is difficult to anticipate. While the extent of the anatomical brain lesion is only poorly correlated with the prognosis, functional measures of cortical synchrony, brain networks and cortical plasticity seem to be good predictors of clinical recovery. In this field, gamma ({$>$}30~Hz) cortical synchrony is an ideal marker of brain function, as it plays a crucial role for the integration of information, it is an indirect marker of Glutamate/GABA balance and it directly estimates the reserve of parvalbulin-positive neurons, key players in synaptic plasticity. In this study we measured gamma synchronization driven by external auditory stimulation with magnetoencephalography and tested whether it was predictive of the clinical outcome in stroke survivors undergoing intensive rehabilitation in a tertiary rehabilitation center. Material and methods Eleven stroke survivors undergoing intensive rehabilitation were prospectively recruited. Gamma synchrony was measured non-invasively within one month from stroke onset with magnetoencephalography, both at rest and during entrainment with external 40~Hz amplitude modulated binaural sounds. Lesion location and volume were quantitatively assessed through a high-resolution anatomical MRI. Barthel index (BI) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scales were measured at the beginning and at the end of the admission to the rehabilitation unit. Results The spatial distribution of cortical gamma synchrony was altered, and the physiological right hemispheric dominance observed in healthy controls was attenuated or lost. Entrained gamma synchronization (but not resting state gamma synchrony) showed a very high correlation with the clinical status at both admission and discharge (both BI and FIM). Neither clinical status nor gamma synchrony showed a correlation with lesion volume. Conclusions Cortical gamma synchrony related to auditory entrainment can be reliably measured in stroke patients. Gamma synchrony is strongly associated with the clinical outcome of stroke survivors undergoing rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique able to induce plasticity phenomena. Although tDCS application has been spreading over a variety of neuroscience domains, the mechanisms by which the stimulation acts are largely unknown. We investigated tDCS effects on cortical gamma synchrony, which is a crucial player in cortical function. We performed a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind study on healthy subjects, combining tDCS and magnetoencephalography. By driving brain activity via 40 Hz auditory stimulation during magnetoencephalography, we experimentally tuned cortical gamma synchrony and measured it before and after bilateral tDCS of the primary sensory-motor hand regions (anode left, cathode right). We demonstrated that the stimulation induces a remarkable decrease of gamma synchrony (13 out of 15 subjects), as measured by gamma phase at 40 Hz. tDCS has strong remote effects, as the cortical region mostly affected was located far away from the stimulation site and covered a large area of the right centro-temporal cortex. No significant differences between stimulations were found for baseline gamma synchrony, as well as early transient auditory responses. This suggests a specific tDCS effect on externally driven gamma synchronization. This study sheds new light on the effect of tDCS on cortical function showing that the net effect of the stimulation on cortical gamma synchronization is an inhibition.},

  abstract = {Background Cortical excitability measures neural reactivity to stimuli, usually delivered via Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Excitation/inhibition balance (E/I) is the ongoing equilibrium between excitatory and inhibitory activity of neural circuits. According to some studies, E/I could be estimated in-vivo and non-invasively through the modeling of electroencephalography (EEG) signals and termed `intrinsic excitability' measures. Several measures have been proposed (phase consistency in the gamma band, sample entropy, exponent of the power spectral density 1/f curve, E/I index extracted from detrend fluctuation analysis, and alpha power). Intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique allowing controlled and focal enhancement of TMS cortical excitability and E/I of the stimulated hemisphere. Objective Investigating to what extent E/I estimates scale with TMS excitability and how they relate to each other. Methods M1 excitability (TMS) and several E/I estimates extracted from resting state EEG recordings were assessed before and after iTBS in a cohort of healthy subjects. Results Enhancement of TMS M1 excitability, as measured through motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), and phase consistency of the cortex in high gamma band correlated with each other. Other measures of E/I showed some expected results, but no correlation with TMS excitability measures or strong consistency with each other. Conclusions EEG E/I estimates offer an intriguing opportunity to map cortical excitability non-invasively, with high spatio-temporal resolution and with a stimulus independent approach. While different EEG E/I estimates may reflect the activity of diverse excitatory-inhibitory circuits, spatial phase synchrony in the gamma band is the measure that best captures excitability changes in the primary motor cortex.},

  abstract = {Cognitive and behavioral processes are often accompanied by changes within well-defined frequency bands of the local field potential (LFP i.e., the voltage induced by neuronal activity). These changes are detectable in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform and are often interpreted as neuronal oscillations. However, aside some well-known exceptions, the processes underlying such changes are difficult to track in time, making their oscillatory nature hard to verify. In addition, many non-periodic neural processes can also have spectra that emphasize specific frequencies. Thus, the notion that spectral changes reflect oscillations is likely too restrictive. In this study, we use a simple yet versatile framework to understand the frequency spectra of neural recordings. Using simulations, we derive the Fourier spectra of periodic, quasi-periodic and non-periodic neural processes having diverse waveforms, illustrating how these attributes shape their spectral signatures. We then show how neural processes sum their energy in the local field potential in simulated and real-world recording scenarios. We find that the spectral power of neural processes is essentially determined by two aspects: (1) the distribution of neural events in time and (2) the waveform of the voltage induced by single neural events. Taken together, this work guides the interpretation of the Fourier spectrum of neural recordings and indicates that power increases in specific frequency bands do not necessarily reflect periodic neural activity.},

Electrical measurements of large-scale brain dynamics, termed field potentials, are especially important to understanding and treating the human brain. Here, our goal is to provide best practices on how field potential recordings (electroencephalograms, magnetoencephalograms, electrocorticograms and local field potentials) can be analyzed to identify large-scale brain dynamics, and to highlight critical issues and limitations of interpretation in current work. We focus our discussion of analyses around the broad themes of activation, correlation, communication and coding. We provide recommendations for interpreting the data using forward and inverse models. The forward model describes how field potentials are generated by the activity of populations of neurons. The inverse model describes how to infer the activity of populations of neurons from field potential recordings. A recurring theme is the challenge of understanding how field potentials reflect neuronal population activity given the complexity of the underlying brain systems.},

However, it is unknown to what extent these complex band-limited changes are interrelated or, alternatively, reflect separate neuronal processes. To address this question, intracranial electrocorticograms (ECoG) responses were recorded in patients engaged in visuomotor tasks. We found that in the 10- to 100-Hz frequency range there was a significant reduction in the exponent {$\chi$} of the 1/f{$\chi$} component of the spectrum associated with neuronal activation. In a minority of electrodes showing particularly high activations the exponent reduction was associated with specific band-limited power modulations: emergence of a high gamma (80--100 Hz) and a decrease in the alpha (9--12 Hz) peaks. Importantly, the peaks' height was correlated with the 1/f{$\chi$} exponent on activation. Control simulation ruled out the possibility that the change in 1/f{$\chi$} exponent was a consequence of the analysis procedure. These results reveal a new global, cross-frequency (10--100 Hz) neuronal process reflected in a significant reduction of the power spectrum slope of the ECoG signal.},

Almost 100 years later, alpha rhythms are still the subject of active investigation and continue to intrigue researchers. What we have perhaps forgotten though, is the clever experimentation that was carried out during the first decades of electroencephalogram (EEG) research, often using sophisticated, custom-made analysis and stimulation devices. Here, I review selected findings from the early EEG literature regarding the character, origin, and meaning of human brain rhythms, beginning with Berger's publications and then focusing on the use of regular visual stimulation as a tool to understand intrinsic brain rhythms. It is clear that many of these findings are still relevant to open questions about the role of rhythmic brain activity. In addition, they also contain some general lessons for contemporary neuroscientists, meaning that there is great value in looking back at these forgotten publications.},

Some widely used spectrum estimators make use of averaging across time segments to reduce noise in the final spectrum. The core of this approach has not changed substantially since the 1960s, though many advances in the field of regression modelling and statistics have been made during this time. Here, we propose a new approach, the General Linear Model (GLM) Spectrum, which reframes time averaged spectral estimation as multiple regression. This brings several benefits, including the ability to do confound modelling, hierarchical modelling, and significance testing via non-parametric statistics. We apply the approach to a dataset of EEG recordings of participants who alternate between eyes-open and eyes-closed resting state. The GLM-Spectrum can model both conditions, quantify their differences, and perform denoising through confound regression in a single step. This application is scaled up from a single channel to a whole head recording and, finally, applied to quantify age differences across a large group-level dataset. We show that the GLM-Spectrum lends itself to rigorous modelling of within- and between-subject contrasts as well as their interactions, and that the use of model-projected spectra provides an intuitive visualisation. The GLMSpectrum is a flexible framework for robust multilevel analysis of power spectra, with adaptive covariate and confound modelling.},

Recent advances in understanding neural systems that process sensory information, various types of memories and social and emotional behaviors are reviewed and compared with known abnormalities in autism. Then, specific genetic abnormalities that are linked with autism are examined. Synthesis of this information leads to a model that postulates that some forms of autism are caused by an increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in sensory, mnemonic, social and emotional systems. The model further postulates that the increased ratio of excitation/inhibition can be caused by combinatorial effects of genetic and environmental variables that impinge upon a given neural system.

Challenges to this approach have arisen over the past 6~decades, but they have largely been unheeded. There is a growing movement for using Bayesian statistical inference to quantify the probability that a scientific finding is credible. There have been differences of opinion between the frequentist (i.e., NHST) and Bayesian schools of inference, and warnings about the use or misuse of P values have come from both schools of thought spanning many decades. Controversies in this arena have been heightened by the American Statistical Association statement on P values and the further denouncement of the term ``statistical significance'' by others. My experience has been that many scientists, including many statisticians, do not have a sound conceptual grasp of the fundamental differences in these approaches, thereby creating even greater confusion and acrimony. If we let A represent the observed data, and B represent the hypothesis of interest, then the fundamental distinction between these two approaches can be described as the frequentist approach using the conditional probability pr(A {\textbar} B) (i.e., the P value), and the Bayesian approach using pr(B {\textbar} A) (the posterior probability). This paper will further explain the fundamental differences in NHST and Bayesian approaches and demonstrate how they can co-exist harmoniously to guide clinical trial design and inference.},

This study aimed to examine the role of evoked spectral power and phase-coherence towards deviance detection and its impairments in schizophrenia. Methods Magnetoencephalography data was collected in 16 male schizophrenia patients and 16 male control participants during an auditory MMN paradigm. Analyses of event-related fields (ERF), spectral power and inter-trial phase-coherence (ITPC) focused on Heschl's gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, inferior/medial frontal gyrus and thalamus. Results MMNm ERF amplitudes were reduced in patients in temporal, frontal and subcortical regions, accompanied by decreased theta-band responses, as well as by a diminished gamma-band response in auditory cortex. At theta/alpha frequencies, ITPC to deviant tones was reduced in patients in frontal cortex and thalamus. Patients were also characterized by aberrant responses to standard tones as indexed by reduced theta-/alpha-band power and ITPC in temporal and frontal regions. Moreover, stimulus-specific adaptation was decreased at theta/alpha frequencies in left temporal regions, which correlated with reduced MMNm spectral power and ERF amplitude. Finally, phase-reset of alpha-oscillations after deviant tones in left thalamus was impaired, which correlated with impaired MMNm generation in auditory cortex. Importantly, both non-rhythmic and rhythmic components of spectral activity contributed to the MMNm response. Conclusions Our data indicate that deficits in theta-/alpha- and gamma-band activity in cortical and subcortical regions as well as impaired spectral responses to standard sounds could constitute potential mechanisms for dysfunctional MMN generation in schizophrenia, providing a novel perspective towards MMN deficits in the disorder.},

  abstract = {A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological ``atoms''. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches. The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations. Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise fMRI data. Multiresolution parcellations generated from 1489 participants are publicly available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable\_projects/brain\_parcellation/Schaefer2018\_LocalGlobal).},

  abstract = {Alterations in the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition (E:I balance) have been implicated in the neural circuit activity--based processes that contribute to autism phenotypes. We investigated whether acutely reducing E:I balance in mouse brain could correct deficits in social behavior. We used mice lacking the CNTNAP2 gene, which has been implicated in autism, and achieved a temporally precise reduction in E:I balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) either by optogenetically increasing the excitability of inhibitory parvalbumin (PV) neurons or decreasing the excitability of excitatory pyramidal neurons. Surprisingly, both of these distinct, real-time, and reversible optogenetic modulations acutely rescued deficits in social behavior and hyperactivity in adult mice lacking CNTNAP2. Using fiber photometry, we discovered that native mPFC PV neuronal activity differed between CNTNAP2 knockout and wild-type mice. During social interactions with other mice, PV neuron activity increased in wild-type mice compared to interactions with a novel object, whereas this difference was not observed in CNTNAP2 knockout mice. Together, these results suggest that real-time modulation of E:I balance in the mouse prefrontal cortex can rescue social behavior deficits reminiscent of autism phenotypes.},

The notion of clinical perfectionism and CBT for perfectionism has been controversial. Despite 15 randomised controlled trials which have demonstrated the efficacy of CBT for perfectionism in reducing perfectionism and symptoms of anxiety, depression and eating disorders, strong responses to this work continue to appear in the literature. In this article, we examine the evolution and controversy surrounding clinical perfectionism, the efficacy of CBT for perfectionism, and future directions for the concept of perfectionism and its treatment. Future research should aim to provide independent evaluations of treatment efficacy, compare CBT for perfectionism to active treatments, conduct dismantling trials to examine the effective components of treatment, and examine the causal processes involved in perfectionism. We provide recommendations for future pathways to support innovation in theory, understanding, and treatment of perfectionism with a view towards improving clinical outcomes.},

  abstract = {The first part of the paper is devoted to a comparison between the functional architectures of the cerebral cortex and artificial intelligent systems. While the two systems share numerous features, natural systems differ in at least four important aspects: i) the prevalence of recurrent connections, ii) the ability to use the temporal domain for computations, iii) the ability to perform "in memory" computations and iv) the prevalence of analog computations. The second part of the paper focuses on a simulation study that has been designed to answer the long-standing question of whether the oscillatory patterning of neuronal activity, which is a hallmark of natural systems, is an epiphenomenon of recurrent interactions or serves a functional role. To this end, recurrent neuronal networks were simulated to capture essential features of cortical networks, and their performance was tested on standard pattern recognition benchmark tests. In order to control the oscillatory regime of these networks, its nodes were configured as damped harmonic oscillators. By varying the damping factor, the nodes functioned either as leaky integrators or oscillators. It turned out that networks with oscillatory nodes substantially outperformed their non-oscillating counterparts. The reasons for this superior performance and similarities with natural neuronal networks are discussed. It is concluded that the oscillatory patterning of neuronal responses is functionally relevant because it allows the exploitation of the unique dynamics of coupled oscillators for analog computation.},

Due to this, there is increasing focus on the adaptations required for Autistic and ADHD individuals of current therapeutic approaches such as Schema Therapy. Particular emphasis when creating these adaptations needs to include looking at the developmental experiences, social influences, and continued adversity faced by Autistic and ADHD individuals across the lifespan, and how the narrative around Autism and ADHD within psychotherapy in general needs to change. This paper critically examines the role of attachment, unmet needs, and adverse childhood experiences in Autistic and ADHD individuals and the subsequent impact on schema development and maintenance and mental health. This will include an overview of the current literature in this area, reconsideration of understandings of Autism and ADHD, particular therapeutic considerations and adjustments and importantly discussion around the wider societal changes that need to occur to prevent schema development and reinforcement across the lifespan.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Inhibitory cell fractions in the neocortex and hippocampus are typically maintained at 15 to 30\%, which is assumed to be important for stable dynamics. We have studied systematically the role of precisely controlled excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) cellular ratios on network activity using mice hippocampal cultures. Surprisingly, networks with varying E/I ratios maintain stable bursting dynamics. Interburst intervals remain constant for most ratios, except in the extremes of 0 to 10\% and 90 to 100\% inhibitory cells. Single-cell recordings and modeling suggest that networks adapt to chronic alterations of E/I compositions by balancing E/I connectivity. Gradual blockade of inhibition substantiates the agreement between the model and experiment and defines its limits. Combining measurements of population and single-cell activity with theoretical modeling, we provide a clearer picture of how E/I balance is preserved and where it fails in living neuronal networks.},

The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) has been the most robust probe of abnormal gamma oscillatory dynamics in schizophrenia. Here, we review recent ASSR studies in patients with schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Preclinical ASSR research, which has contributed to the elucidation of the underlying pathophysiology of these diseases, is also discussed. The developmental trajectory of the ASSR has been explored and may show signs of the maturation and disruption of E/I balance in adolescence. Animal model studies have shown that synaptic interactions between parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons and pyramidal neurons contribute to the regulation of E/I balance, which is related to the generation of gamma oscillation. Therefore, ASSR alteration may be a significant electrophysiological finding related to the E/I imbalance in neuropsychiatric disorders, which is a cross-disease feature and may reflect clinical staging. Future studies regarding ASSR generation, especially in nonhuman primate models, will advance our understanding of the brain circuit and the molecular mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric disorders.},

Here, we evaluated the test--retest reliability of auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) over two MEG sessions. The study required participants (N=13) to detect the rare occurrence of pure tones interspersed within a stream of 5Hz or 40Hz amplitude-modulated (AM) tones. Intraclass correlations (ICC; Shrout and Fleiss, 1979) were derived to assess stability of spectral power changes and the inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) of task-elicited neural responses. ASSRs source activity was estimated using eLORETA beamforming from bilateral auditory cortex. ASSRs to 40Hz AM stimuli evoked stronger power modulation and phase-locking than 5Hz stimulation. Overall, spectral power and ITPC values at both sensor- and source-level showed robust ICC values. Notably, ITPC measures yielded higher ICCs ({\textasciitilde}0.86--0.96) between sessions compared to the assessment of spectral power change ({\textasciitilde}0.61--0.82). Our data indicate that spectral modulations and phase consistency of ASSRs in MEG data are highly reproducible, providing support for MEG-measured oscillatory parameters in basic and clinical research.},

  abstract = {Most neuroimaging studies display results that represent only a tiny fraction of the collected data. While it is conventional to present "only the significant results" to the reader, here we suggest that this practice has several negative consequences for both reproducibility and understanding. This practice hides away most of the results of the dataset and leads to problems of selection bias and irreproducibility, both of which have been recognized as major issues in neuroimaging studies recently. Opaque, all-or-nothing thresholding, even if well-intentioned, places undue influence on arbitrary filter values, hinders clear communication of scientific results, wastes data, is antithetical to good scientific practice, and leads to conceptual inconsistencies. It is also inconsistent with the properties of the acquired data and the underlying biology being studied. Instead of presenting only a few statistically significant locations and hiding away the remaining results, studies should "highlight" the former while also showing as much as possible of the rest. This is distinct from but complementary to utilizing data sharing repositories: the initial presentation of results has an enormous impact on the interpretation of a study. We present practical examples and extensions of this approach for voxelwise, regionwise and cross-study analyses using publicly available data that was analyzed previously by 70 teams (NARPS; Botvinik-Nezer, et~al., 2020), showing that it is possible to balance the goals of displaying a full set of results with providing the reader reasonably concise and "digestible" findings. In particular, the highlighting approach sheds useful light on the kind of variability present among the NARPS teams' results, which is primarily a varied strength of agreement rather than disagreement. Using a meta-analysis built on the informative "highlighting" approach shows this relative agreement, while one using the standard "hiding" approach does not. We describe how this simple but powerful change in practice---focusing on highlighting results, rather than hiding all but the strongest ones---can help address many large concerns within the field, or at least to provide more complete information about them. We include a list of practical suggestions for results reporting to improve reproducibility, cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses.},

  abstract = {How does the brain enable us to remember two or more object representations in visual working memory (VWM) without confusing them? This ``gluing'' process, or feature binding, refers to the ability to join certain features together while keeping them segregated from others. Recent neuroimaging research has reported higher BOLD response in the left temporal and parietal cortex during a binding-VWM task. However, less is known about how the two regions work in synchrony to support such process. In this study, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) over the left temporal and parietal cortex in gamma and theta frequency, with a phase difference of either 0{$^\circ$} (in-phase) or 180{$^\circ$} (anti-phase) to account for the different ways through which neural synchronization may occur. We found no facilitatory or inhibitory effect from sham, theta and in-phase gamma stimulation. Importantly, there was an enhancement effect from anti-phase gamma tACS that was binding-specific and such effect was only apparent in low-performing individuals who had room for improvement. Together, these results demonstrate that binding-VWM is supported by a temporally-precise oscillatory mechanism within the gamma frequency range and that the advantageous 180{$^\circ$}-apart phase relationship also implies a possible temporal driver-to-receiver time-lag between the temporal and parietal cortex.},

But what is a neural mechanism, and how do we know we have captured them? Here I answer these questions through a framework that integrates Marr's levels with philosophical work on mechanism. From this, the following goal emerges: What needs to be explained are the computations of cognition, with explanation itself given by mechanism---composed of algorithms and parts of the brain that realize them. This reveals a delineation within cognitive neuroscience research. In the premechanism stage, the computations of cognition are linked to phenomena in the brain, narrowing down where and when mechanisms are situated in space and time. In the mechanism stage, it is established how computation emerges from organized interactions between parts---filling the premechanistic mold. I explain why a shift toward mechanistic modeling helps us meet our aims while outlining a road map for doing so. Finally, I argue that the explanatory scope of neural mechanisms can be approximated by effect sizes collected across studies, not just conceptual analysis. Together, these points synthesize a mechanistic agenda that allows subfields to connect at the level of theory.},

Here, we argue that the question of whether oscillations are epiphenomenal is ill-defined and cannot be productively resolved without further refinement. Toward that end, we outline a conceptual framework that clarifies the dispute along two axes: first, we introduce a distinction between measurement and process to categorize the theoretical status of electrophysiology terms such as local field potentials and oscillations. Second, we consider the relationships between these disambiguated terms, evaluating based on experimental and computational evidence whether there exist causal or inferentially useful links between them. This decomposes the question of epiphenomenalism into a set of empirically tractable alternatives. Finally, we demarcate oscillations as a conceptually distinct entity where either processes or measurements exhibit periodic behavior, and we suggest that oscillatory processes orchestrate neural computation by implementing a temporal, spatial, and frequency syntax. Overall, our reframed evaluation supports the view that electric fields---oscillating or not---are causally relevant, and that their associated signals are informative. More broadly, we offer a vocabulary and starting point for scientific exchanges on the role and utility of brain signals and the biological processes they capture.},

  title = {Uncovering Neural Patterns of Cognition by Aligning Oscillatory Dynamics},
  author = {{van Bree}, Sander},
  abstract = {A primary aim of cognitive neuroscience is to explain how cognition is physically realized by the brain. Toward this end, neuroscientists study consistent activity patterns produced across ensembles of neurons. Importantly, such ensembles are subject to excitability fluctuations imposed by neural oscillations, which are used in a self-organized way to realize windows of effective communication, coding schemes, a switch between memory processes, interareal information exchange, and other functions. Given the intimate link between oscillations and neural processing, this thesis explores the power of studying activity patterns of cognition with reference to brain dynamics. Specifically, I submit that spectral information like phase and oscillatory cycles offer a brain-intrinsic coordinate system by which the readout of neurocognitive patterns can be assisted. From this vantage point, I explore two methodological advances: (1) brain time warping, which incorporates oscillatory dynamics post-hoc after brain data has been acquired, and (2) visual perturbation or ``pings'', which artificially regularize oscillations as memory retrieval is ongoing. We demonstrate that brain time warping can reveal activity patterns otherwise left undetected, and we introduce a comprehensive toolbox to apply the algorithm and test its effects. On the other hand, we found no evidence that pings enhance the readout of memory representations from electroencephalography data. Together, these empirical and theoretical points underscore the need for a neurally inspired methodology in which scientists are cast as spectators with privileged access to external world variables.},

There is also the assumption that changes in power track modulations in oscillatory activity at that frequency. However, these assumptions may be incorrect because apparent changes in power at a frequency may be caused by any number of other factors. These include changes in the non-rhythmic, aperiodic ``background'' exponent or offset, or even a change in the nonsinusoidal waveform shapes of a true oscillation. Thus, it is crucial to carefully parameterize many features of the EEG signal, in both the time and frequency domains, in order to better understand how neural oscillations link to behavior, cognition, perception, and disease. This chapter describes emerging approaches to quantifying these parameters---periodic oscillation shape, frequency, amplitude, and bandwidth, as well as aperiodic exponent and offset---in the EEG.},

  abstract = {Synchronous rhythms represent a core mechanism for sculpting temporal coordination of neural activity in the brain-wide network. This review focuses on oscillations in the cerebral cortex that occur during cognition, in alert behaving conditions. Over the last two decades, experimental and modeling work has made great strides in elucidating the detailed cellular and circuit basis of these rhythms, particularly gamma and theta rhythms. The underlying physiological mechanisms are diverse (ranging from resonance and pacemaker properties of single cells to multiple scenarios for population synchronization and wave propagation), but also exhibit unifying principles. A major conceptual advance was the realization that synaptic inhibition plays a fundamental role in rhythmogenesis, either in an interneuronal network or in a reciprocal excitatory-inhibitory loop. Computational functions of synchronous oscillations in cognition are still a matter of debate among systems neuroscientists, in part because the notion of regular oscillation seems to contradict the common observation that spiking discharges of individual neurons in the cortex are highly stochastic and far from being clocklike. However, recent findings have led to a framework that goes beyond the conventional theory of coupled oscillators and reconciles the apparent dichotomy between irregular single neuron activity and field potential oscillations. From this perspective, a plethora of studies will be reviewed on the involvement of long-distance neuronal coherence in cognitive functions such as multisensory integration, working memory, and selective attention. Finally, implications of abnormal neural synchronization are discussed as they relate to mental disorders like schizophrenia and autism.},

  abstract = {Background:{\enspace} The lack of robust and reliable clinical biomarkers in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, has limited the successful translation of bench-to-bedside therapeutics. While numerous drugs have shown promise in reversing synaptic and behavioral phenotypes in mouse models of FXS, none have demonstrated clinical efficacy in humans. Electroencephalographic (EEG) measures have been identified as candidate biomarkers as EEG recordings of both adults with FXS and mouse models of FXS consistently exhibit alterations in resting state and task-related activity. However, the developmental timing of these EEG differences is not known as thus far EEG studies have not focused on young children with FXS. Further, understanding how EEG differences are associated with core symptoms of FXS is crucial to successful use of EEG as a biomarker, and may improve our understanding of the disorder. Methods:{\enspace} Resting-state EEG was collected from FXS boys with full mutation of Fmr1 (2.5--7 years old, n\,=\,11) and compared with both age-matched (n\,=\,12) and cognitive-matched (n\,=\,12) typically developing boys. Power spectra (including aperiodic and periodic components) were compared using non-parametric cluster-based permutation testing. Associations between 30 and 50 Hz gamma power and cognitive, language, and behavioral measures were evaluated using Pearson correlation and linear regression with age as a covariate. Results:{\enspace} FXS participants showed increased power in the beta/gamma range ({\textasciitilde}\,25--50 Hz) across multiple brain regions. Both a reduction in the aperiodic (1/f) slope and increase in beta/gamma periodic activity contributed to the significant increase in high-frequency power. Increased gamma power, driven by the aperiodic component, was associated with better language ability in the FXS group. No association was observed between gamma power and parent report measures of behavioral challenges, sensory hypersensitivities, or adaptive behaviors. Limitations:{\enspace} The study sample size was small, although comparable to other human studies in rare-genetic disorders. Findings are also limited to males in the age range studied. Conclusions:{\enspace} Resting-state EEG measures from this study in young boys with FXS identified similar increases in gamma power previously reported in adults and mouse models. The observed positive association between resting state aperiodic gamma power and language development supports hypotheses that alterations in some EEG measures may reflect ongoing compensatory mechanisms.},

Recent advances in parameterizing neural power spectra offer practical tools for evaluating these features separately. Although neural signals vary dynamically and express non-stationarity in relation to ongoing behaviour and perception, current methods yield static spectral decompositions. Here, we introduce Spectral Parameterization Resolved in Time (SPRiNT) as a novel method for decomposing complex neural dynamics into periodic and aperiodic spectral elements in a time-resolved manner. First, we demonstrate, with naturalistic synthetic data, SPRiNT's capacity to reliably recover time-varying spectral features. We emphasize SPRiNT's specific strengths compared to other time-frequency parameterization approaches based on wavelets. Second, we use SPRiNT to illustrate how aperiodic spectral features fluctuate across time in empirical resting-state EEG data (n=178) and relate the observed changes in aperiodic parameters over time to participants' demographics and behaviour. Lastly, we use SPRiNT to demonstrate how aperiodic dynamics relate to movement behaviour in intracranial recordings in rodents. We foresee SPRiNT responding to growing neuroscientific interests in the parameterization of time-varying neural power spectra and advancing the quantitation of complex neural dynamics at the natural time scales of behaviour.},

Data-driven model selection enhances both the specificity and sensitivity of spectral and spectrogram decompositions, even in non-stationary contexts. Overall, the proposed spectral decomposition with data-driven model selection minimizes the reliance on user expertise and subjective choices, enabling more robust, reproducible, and interpretable research findings. Lay summary Brain activity is composed of rhythmic patterns that repeat over time and arrhythmic elements that are less structured. Recent advances in brain signal analysis have improved our ability to distinguish between these two types of components, enhancing our understanding of brain signals. However, current methods require users to adjust several parameters manually to obtain their results. The outcomes of the analyses therefore depend on each user's decisions and expertise. To improve the replicability of research findings, the authors propose a new, automated method to streamline the analysis of brain signal contents. They developed a new algorithm that defines the parameters of the analytical pipeline informed by the data. The effectiveness of this new method is demonstrated with both synthesized and real-world data. The new approach is made available to all researchers as a free, open-source app, observing best practices for neuroscience research.},

  abstract = {Rhythms are a common feature of brain activity. Across different types of rhythms, the phase has been proposed to have functional consequences, thus requiring its accurate specification from noisy data. Phase is conventionally specified using techniques that presume a frequency band-limited rhythm. However, in practice, observed brain rhythms are typically nonsinusoidal and amplitude modulated. How these features impact methods to estimate phase remains unclear. To address this, we consider three phase estimation methods, each with different underlying assumptions about the rhythm. We apply these methods to rhythms simulated with different generative mechanisms and demonstrate inconsistency in phase estimates across the different methods. We propose two improvements to the practice of phase estimation: (1) estimating confidence in the phase estimate, and (2) examining the consistency of phase estimates between two (or more) methods.},

  abstract = {Studies of perception and cognition in schizophrenia (SCZ) show neuronal background noise (ongoing activity) to intermittently overwhelm the processing of external stimuli. This increased noise, relative to the activity evoked by the stimulus, results in temporal imprecision and higher variability of behavioral responses. What, however, are the neural correlates of temporal imprecision in SCZ behavior? We first report a decrease in electroencephalography signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in two SCZ datasets and tasks in the broadband (1--80 Hz), theta (4--8 Hz), and alpha (8--13 Hz) bands. SCZ participants also show lower inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC)---consistency over trials in the phase of the signal---in theta. From these ITPC results, we varied phase offsets in a computational simulation, which illustrated phase-based temporal desynchronization. This modeling also provided a necessary link to our results and showed decreased neural synchrony in SCZ in both datasets and tasks when compared with healthy controls. Finally, we showed that reduced SNR and ITPC are related and showed a relationship to temporal precision on the behavioral level, namely reaction times. In conclusion, we demonstrate how temporal imprecision in SCZ neural activity---reduced relative signal strength and phase coherence---mediates temporal imprecision on the behavioral level.},

Phase relations supporting interactions between the groups preceded those interactions by a few milliseconds, consistent with a mechanistic role.

  abstract = {Ongoing interactions among cortical neurons often manifest as network-level synchrony. Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of such spontaneous synchrony is important because it may (1) influence network response to input, (2) shape activity-dependent microcircuit structure, and (3) reveal fundamental network properties, such as an imbalance of excitation (               E               ) and inhibition (               I               ). Here we delineate the spatiotemporal character of spontaneous synchrony in rat cortex slice cultures and a computational model over a range of different               E--I               conditions including disfacilitated (antagonized AMPA, NMDA receptors), unperturbed, and disinhibited (antagonized GABA               A               receptors). Local field potential was recorded with multielectrode arrays during spontaneous burst activity. Synchrony among neuronal groups was quantified based on phase-locking among recording sites. As network excitability was increased from low to high, we discovered three phenomena at an intermediate excitability level: (1) onset of synchrony, (2) maximized variability of synchrony, and (3) neuronal avalanches. Our computational model predicted that these three features occur when the network operates near a unique balanced               E--I               condition called ``criticality.'' These results were invariant to changes in the measurement spatial extent, spatial resolution, and frequency bands. Our findings indicate that moderate average synchrony, which is required to avoid pathology, occurs over a limited range of               E--I               conditions and emerges together with maximally variable synchrony. If variable synchrony is detrimental to cortical function, this is a cost paid for moderate average synchrony. However, if variable synchrony is beneficial, then by operating near criticality the cortex may doubly benefit from moderate mean and maximized variability of synchrony.},

While previous studies have associated cortical hyperexcitability with brain state changes induced by sleep deprivation, whether cortical hypoexcitability is also linked to brain state changes and, if so, how it could affect cognitive performance remain unknown. Here, we address these questions by examining the brain state change occurring after meals, i.e., postprandial somnolence, and comparing it with that induced by sleep deprivation. By analyzing features representing network excitability based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, we confirmed cortical hyperexcitability under sleep deprivation but revealed hypoexcitability under postprandial somnolence. In addition, we found that both sleep deprivation and postprandial somnolence adversely affected the level of vigilance. These results indicate that cortical E/I balance toward inhibition is associated with brain state changes, and deviation from the balanced state, regardless of its direction, could impair cognitive performance.},

However, while control of time-varying E/I balance is considered essential for perceptual and motor learning, an efficient method for estimating E/I balance changes has yet to be established. To tackle this issue, we propose a method to estimate E/I balance changes by applying neural-mass model-based tracking of the brain state using the Ensemble Kalman Filter. In this method, the parameters of synaptic E/I gains in the model are estimated from observed electroencephalography signals. Moreover, the index of E/I balance was defined by calculating the ratio between synaptic E/I gains based on estimated parameters. The method was validated by showing that it could estimate E/I balance changes from human electroencephalography data at the sub-second scale, indicating that it has the potential to quantify how time-varying changes in E/I balance influence changes in perceptual and motor learning. Furthermore, this method could be used to develop an E/I balance-based neurofeedback training method for clinical use.},

Using neuromagnetic brain signals recorded from healthy participants during somatosensory stimuli, we compared the performance of four phase synchronization measures, imaginary part of phase-locking value, imaginary part of coherency (ImCoh), phase lag index and weighted phase lag index (wPLI), for detecting stimulus-induced FCs between the contralateral primary and ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortices. The analyses revealed that ImCoh exhibited the best performance for detecting stimulus-induced FCs, followed by the wPLI. We found that amplitude weighting, which is related to computing both ImCoh and wPLI, effectively attenuated the influence of noise contamination. A simulation study modeling noise-contaminated periodograms replicated these findings. The present results suggest that the amplitude-dependent measures, ImCoh followed by wPLI, may have the advantage in detecting stimulus-induced FCs.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Experimental observations suggest that diverse neural timescales reflect information in dynamic environments. However, how timescales are defined and measured from brain recordings vary across the literature. Moreover, these observations do not specify the mechanisms underlying timescale variations, nor whether specific timescales are necessary for neural computation and brain function. Here, we synthesize three directions where computational approaches can distill the broad set of empirical observations into quantitative and testable theories: We review (i) how different data analysis methods quantify timescales across distinct behavioral states and recording modalities, (ii) how biophysical models provide mechanistic explanations for the emergence of diverse timescales, and (iii) how task-performing networks and machine learning models uncover the functional relevance of neural timescales. This integrative computational perspective thus complements experimental investigations, providing a holistic view on how neural timescales reflect the relationship between brain structure, dynamics, and behavior.},

Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains -- including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry -- are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies. Open questions and forthcoming areas of investigation are also considered.},

  abstract = {Neural synchrony in the brain is often present in an intermittent fashion, i.e., there are intervals of synchronized activity interspersed with intervals of desynchronized activity. A series of experimental studies showed that this kind of temporal patterning of neural synchronization may be very specific and may be correlated with behaviour (even if the average synchrony strength is not changed). Prior studies showed that a network with many short desynchronized intervals may be functionally different from a network with few long desynchronized intervals as it may be more sensitive to synchronizing input signals. In this study, we investigated the effect of channel noise on the temporal patterns of neural synchronization. We employed a small network of conductance-based model neurons that were mutually connected via excitatory synapses. The resulting dynamics of the network was studied using the same time-series analysis methods as used in prior experimental and computational studies. While it is well known that synchrony strength generally degrades with noise, we found that noise also affects the temporal patterning of synchrony. Noise, at a sufficient intensity (yet too weak to substantially affect synchrony strength), promotes dynamics with predominantly short (although potentially very numerous) desynchronizations. Thus, channel noise may be one of the mechanisms contributing to the short desynchronization dynamics observed in multiple experimental studies.},
